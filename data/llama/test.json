Lee, MD.\nThe heart compensates for a significant loss of blood through a process called the \"compensatory response.\" When blood volume is low, the body tries to maintain blood pressure and perfusion of vital organs. The heart beats faster (tachycardia) to pump more blood, and the blood vessels constrict (vasoconstriction) to reduce blood flow to non-essential areas. This helps to maintain blood pressure and ensure that vital organs receive enough oxygen and nutrients. The kidneys also help by releasing hormones that stimulate the release of more red blood cells and fluid from the body to replace lost blood volume. This process is usually temporary and reversible, but in severe cases, it can lead to shock and organ failure if not promptly addressed. (Source: Dr. M.

A 40mm headphone driver can still produce low bass notes because it's designed to be more efficient and have a larger surface area than a loudspeaker driver of the same size. This is because headphones are designed to be close to the ear, so they don't need to project sound as far, and the sound waves can be more tightly packed. In contrast, loudspeaker drivers need to project sound over a longer distance, which requires more power and a larger size to produce the same level of bass. Think of it like a car engine vs a motorcycle engine - both can produce power, but the car engine needs to be bigger and more powerful to propel a heavier load over a longer distance.\u00a0\nThis is a simplified explanation, but I hope it gives you an idea of the key differences between headphones and loudspeakers.\u00a0\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!\u00a0\nP.S. - It's worth noting that there are some high-end loudspeaker drivers that are designed to be very efficient and can produce good bass response even at smaller sizes.

One major reason is the sonic boom, which is a loud noise created when an object breaks the sound barrier. To avoid this, planes need to fly high enough to minimize the impact of the boom on the ground. However, flying high also means there's less air density, which makes it harder to generate lift and speed. Additionally, the heat generated by friction at high speeds can be a problem. As a result, planes have to balance speed with efficiency and safety, which limits how fast they can go. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

            " Planes have been getting faster over the past century, but the rate of improvement has slowed in recent years. There are a few reasons for this: 1) **Air resistance**: As planes get faster, they encounter more air resistance, which slows them down. This makes it harder to achieve significant speed gains. 2) **Aerodynamic limits**: Planes are already very efficient at moving through the air, so there's less room for improvement. 3) **Cost and complexity**: Building a faster plane requires significant investment in new materials, design, and testing. This can be expensive and time-consuming. 4) **Safety concerns**: As planes get faster, they become more difficult to control and land safely. This is a major concern for airlines and regulatory bodies. So, while planes are still getting faster, the rate of improvement is slower due to these challenges. The fastest commercial plane currently in service is the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which has a top speed of around 915 km/h (567 mph). While it's not the fastest plane ever built, it's still a remarkable feat of engineering! (Note: This is an ELI5 answer, so I've kept it short and simple. If you want more details, feel free to ask"

        "answer": "There's a lot of controversy over what causes a side stitch. I've studied it over the years and with well over 200,000 running miles I have plenty of experience. For me, a side stitch comes about from stomach muscles not being synchronized with breathing. Think of it as your chest muscles pulling up as your abdominal muscles pull down. I'm sure that's not technically correct, but that's the effect you experience when the muscles are strained. It can be eliminated/reduced by concentrating on breathing on one side or the other, generally your dominant side. When that foot strikes the ground, you want to be exhaling. Focusing on this will help synchronize the muscles and stop the stitch. There are other causes that increase the likelihood of stitches such as dehydration or stress.",

Think of it like a game of musical chairs. When electrons move into the outer shell, they need to find a stable spot to orbit around the nucleus. Eight electrons can fit comfortably in this spot, kind of like eight people sitting in eight chairs. If there were nine electrons, it would be like one person standing, which is unstable and prone to falling out of the chair. Seven electrons would also be unstable, like one chair missing. This stability is due to the way electrons interact through the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that each orbital can only hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. This principle, combined with the way electrons fill up the available orbitals, leads to the eight-electron configuration in the outer shell. This configuration is stable because it's the most efficient way for electrons to occupy the available space and interact with each other and the nucleus.\u00a0\nThis is a simplified explanation, but it should give you a basic understanding of why eight electrons are typically found in the outer shell of an atom.\u00a0\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that explains the behavior of electrons in"

        "question": "ELI5 How does sound wave energy get converted into electricity and why is it less efficient than solar energy?",
        "answer": "The microphone reflects *a lot* of the sound energy that hits it.  Your simple microphone is like a tiny speaker in reverse where sound hits the diaphragm (little movable plate) and pushes a magnet in and out of a coil of wire.  This little diaphragm is hard on the surface which means that a lot of the sound energy hits it and bounces off rather than being absorbed in pushing the magnet through the coil.  There are little capacitor based ones but the magnet setup is easiest to understand as a reversed speaker.  Solar panels on the other hand are very absorbant of the frequencies they work with.  Some percentage is reflected off the top glass layer but 90% of the light will pass through and then be absorbed down below.  The efficiency of solar panels mostly comes down to the sun emitting light over a wide range of frequencies and our little solar panels only being able to absorb a small range of frequencies which is why the best case efficiency of a single junction solar panel is just 37% because that's the bigger window we can make in the highest energy portion of the sun's spectrum.  Another issue with capturing sound energy is that there just really isn't all that much of it.  If you were to stand 1 meter away from a jet engine its sound level is around 150 dB, but if you were to capture *all* the sound energy from that jet engine it'd be around 1000 W, a 150 dB sound only gives you 1000 W of energy to work with.  You can get that much energy with about 5 m^2 of solar panels and you won't have a giant turbofan engine screaming away in the background.",

        "answer": "It's not magic. A nuclear bomb is an engineering device that creates the conditions for an out-of-control nuclear fission reaction.   Each U-235 atom can be split (fissioned) with a neutron. When it splits, it releases 2-3 neutrons of its own (plus some energy). Each neutron can go only a few centimeters before it disintegrates. For a bomb to work, you need those 2-3 neutrons to split more U-235 atoms, which then split more, which then split more, and so on.   If the amount of uranium you have is too small, the neutrons will eventually reach the surface and escape. The chances of them hitting more U-235 atoms will not be high enough to continue the reaction.  So the \"magic amount\" \u2014\u00a0the critical mass \u2014 is the amount of U-235 you need so that you have the conditions where lots of reactions will take place.   The thing of it is, there are different ways to design a bomb. For example, if you put a neutron reflector around the fuel, those neutrons will have a harder time escaping, so you will need less U-235 for it to work. The main bomb design \"trick\" that people use is called implosion, where you use high explosives to squeeze a ball of fuel into a higher density, so the atoms are closer together \u2014 again, to increase the chance of those neutrons finding more atoms.   There are other tricks as well that can be used to increase the efficiency, many of which get beyond ELI5 levels of explanation. The goal of them is to make more material react, which either means you need less material for a given amount of \"boom,\" or you add more fuel and get a bigger explosion.  So the exact amount you need can vary by bomb design. The lower limits are kept pretty secret but it is clear that with 5 kg or even less of material, with a very sophisticated design, you can get a pretty good explosion. For a very crude design, like the one used on Hiroshima (where you are just shooting two pieces of U-235 together), you could need more than 60 kg. So there is a big gap between those two extremes, though in the end even the \"high end\" is not a huge amount.   Separately, with U-235, the level of enrichment (how much U-235 versus U-238 there is) makes a difference to that amount as well. If you have 93% U-235 (7% U-238), you will need less material than, say, 80% U-235 (20% U-238). U-238 inhibits the reaction and so you will need more U-235 to increase the chance of it fissioning.  If this still sounds confusing, you might enjoy playing around with my [Critical Assembly Simulator](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/misc/criticality/), which allows one to simulate in a \"toy\" way how these reactions work. You can tweak the variables (enrichment, total mass, reflection, implosion, etc.) and see how that changes how the reaction operates.   In terms of how close Iran is to the amount, Iran currently has uranium enriched at the level of 20%. That is not enough for a bomb. It is, however, not that far from 90% \u2014\u00a0a lot less far than it seems (enrichment is not linear; it is more \"work\" to go from 0.7% to 20% than it is 20% to 90%).   To make a bomb, Iran would likely need to build up a stockpile of several dozen kilograms of uranium enriched to at least 80%, more favorable at least 90%. They have said that they will make at most 120 kg of 20% enriched uranium. If they turned all of that into 90% enriched uranium with perfect efficiency, they would have around 25 kg of U-235. That would likely be enough for a few implosion bombs (but not enough for a crude bomb). They would also of course have to do the work of weaponizing it, and need a way to actually launch it (missile warheads, etc.) \u2014 not impossible, but these things take additional time and testing.   In terms of \"how close,\" it really depends on what you assume they are going to be doing politically. They do not appear to be trying to make a bomb just yet. They are clearly positioning themselves to make the West uncomfortable, though, with the idea that if they threw everything they had into making a bomb \u2014 which would be a very obvious sort of move, and require them flagrantly violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \u2014 they might be able to make the material in a matter of months.   Note that Iran's uranium stockpiles and facilities are under close scrutiny not only by the International Atomic Energy Agency (which has cameras in each of them, linked back to their headquarters in Vienna), but the intelligence services of many nations (USA, Israel, no doubt others). So this would be a very blatant act. It doesn't mean they couldn't try it (North Korea pulled out of the NPT in 2003, and tested a bomb in 2006), but it is not the kind of overnight \"they suddenly secretly have a nuke\" that many people fear.",

            "\u00a0\nAnswer: The magical amount is about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of highly enriched uranium (HEU) with a purity of 90% or more. The reason is that it's the amount needed to create a critical mass, where the chain reaction of nuclear fission can sustain itself. This is known as the \"breakout\" point.

Natural uranium is about 0.7% U-235, but for a nuclear bomb, you need it to be around 90% or more. This is done through a process called uranium enrichment, which involves separating the U-235 from the other isotopes in the uranium using centrifuges or other methods.

        "answer": "\"Frighteningly\" is an emotional response and it's driven by overwhelmingly biased media coverage. Mass shootings are actually quite rare, and their associated death tolls pale in comparison to things that are otherwise seemingly benign. The biggest reason why gun control measures aren't passed is because liberal politicians that craft the legislation have a fundamental lack of knowledge on how guns are designed/manufactured/operated.

I'm an engineer. I solve complicated problems for a living. If you want to apply an engineer's brain to gun legislation it would look something like this:  1) Define the problem. Like *really* define it. All the relevant statistics about deaths, associated circumstances, ownership rates, population densities, gang affiliations, education, gender, income distribution, income inequality in areas of high violent crime, mental health, type of firearm, magazine capacity race, etc. Gather all of it.   2) Use statistical methods to analyze the data. All of the data. Even the bits that make people uncomfortable, like gender/race/religion/income. You analyze all of it.  3) Use the descriptive statistical analyses to characterize gun violence from every conceivable angle.   4) Make some guesses as to what legislative measures we want to implement, based on our observations of the descriptive statistics.   5) Make a predictive model that attempts to predict what would happen if certain parameters were changed (i.e. legal age of ownership, waiting periods, magazine capacities, barrel lengths, no AR's, etc.) and then run them through a predictive model to see what outcomes are achieved.  6) Recognize that the items with the largest impact on outcomes are socially uncomfortable and politically inconvenient to talk about.  7) Stop my research for fear of being ostracized.   8) Do nothing.  9) Buy more guns through private party sales without background checks so that the Fed doesn't know I have them.  10) YEEEEHAAWWWWW",

The inverter uses a switching circuit to rapidly switch the DC voltage on and off, creating a pulsating DC current. This is then filtered to create a smooth AC waveform. It's a bit like a high-speed camera taking a series of still photos, which when played back, appear as a movie. The inverter does this process thousands of times per second, creating a waveform that looks like AC current. This process is called \"pulsating DC\" or \"switch-mode\" conversion. It's efficient, with efficiencies of 95% or higher, making it a reliable way to convert DC power to AC power.

            "\u00a0\nThe key to skin recognizing another skin is not the type of skin itself, but rather the presence of certain receptors. Specifically, there are mechanoreceptors and thermoreceptors in our skin that detect movement and temperature. When two skins come into contact, these receptors are triggered, sending signals to the brain. This is what allows us to perceive touch, temperature, and texture. Leather, for example, lacks these receptors, so our skin doesn't get the same signals. It's not the skin itself that recognizes another skin, but rather the complex interactions between skin cells, receptors, and the brain. \nThis explanation is a simplified version of a complex process, but it should give you a general idea of how our skin knows when it's touching another skin. \nHere are some additional resources if you'd like to dive deeper:\n1.

The startle reflex is a reaction in the brain that kicks the body into immediate action to protect itself, bypassing all conscious thought. This has evolved to happen VERY quickly following the sudden dangerous stimulus (aka sounds of a certain volume), while stimuli that don't trigger this reflex don't elicit as quick a reaction time.  There are multiple different reflexes that occur during a startle response, such as in the eye, jaw, head, etc. But the \"acoustic startle reflex\" specifically has its own neural pathway.

They don't actually perform surgery, and if surgery is needed they refer their patients to actual M.D.s to either diagnose more complicated issues or perform surgeries.  They don't need to worry about things that don't involve the procedures they do, and they really only diagnose things that they can see with a quick look(measurement of eyesight/astigmatism, abcess/cavity/etc.) and do what is needed to correct them right then and there, whether it's a root canal or determining the correct lens strength. They don't need to know the workings of the body to do these things, they're only interested in the things that relate to the procedures they do.  They can only use anesthesia if they are trained in it, and it's not only doctors that can use it. If the dentist isn't trained in it, he can have a CRNA that is to administer it.

The lender might agree to this swap, essentially becoming a shareholder in the company, in exchange for a reduced claim on the company's assets.

Above freezing vs. below freezing, credit vs. debt, clockwise vs. counter-clockwise, so on.  The number i is just taking that concept further and extending the number line perpendicularly up and down. Like negative numbers, this extension gives us tools to describe a more cyclic kind of flipping: instead of simply going from 1 to -1, we can rotate around 0 by going up to i and then below to -i in between.  The exact applications of that are somewhat obscure and math-heavy, but they pop up in equations modeling many periodic motions and waveforms.

When a photo of a computer screen is taken, the camera captures a 2D representation of the screen's pixels, which are tiny squares of color. If the screen's resolution is high, but the camera's resolution is lower, the image will appear to have \"jagged\" or \"staircase\" lines. These are aliasing artifacts. When you zoom in on the image, the aliasing becomes more pronounced. This is because the lower-resolution camera is trying to represent a higher-resolution image, and it's not doing a great job.

        "answer": "The choice of electrons as negative was *not* just arbitrary. When early experiments were done before electrons were discovered, it was shown that electricity moves from positive towards negative. This seems counterintuitive at first, because it's the electrons that are moving, right? So electrons are moving from negative to positive, but the *charge* is moving from positive to negative.  Imagine a long line of cars sitting at a red light. When the light turns green, the car at the front of the line moves first. Even though the cars are coming from the back and moving forward, the apparent movement of the *whole line* of cars starts at the front. If you couldn't see individual cars, and they were all the same color, you would see just one long line of *something*. When the first car moves, it would open up a gap or a *hole* behind that car, which the next car would move up to fill. If you were in a helicopter and you had very blurry vision, you'd probably notice that hole appearing to move.  Similarly, when electrons move they leave behind a positively charged \"hole\". Before any electron can move, there has to be a hole in font of it. And when you do math and make models and predictions, you can pretend that the hole acts like a positively charged particle, because it kind of moves around like one. Instead of an electron jumping around, it *looks* like there's a positively charged particle jumping around. Keep in mind that unlike cars, electrons don't slowly travel from one atom to the next: instead, they are around one atom, and then they just *are* at a different atom. They jump across the gap without appearing to move (although they do take time to get there). So without seeing the electrons move individually, it really does look like an overall positive charge is the thing moving.  Thus, early experiments showed that charge came from the end that they labeled as *positive*. After generations, the electron was found but by then the convention was already set, so electrons were stuck as being labeled *negative*. As for why charged particles have charge at all - it's an intrinsic part of the universe and how those particles interact with it. They just kind of...do.",

            "\u00a0\nThe reason for this is due to how we choose to define the charge of a particle. We define an electron as having a negative charge and a proton as having a positive charge. This is a convention that was chosen because it makes calculations easier and more intuitive. It's a bit like how we choose to define up and down on a coordinate plane - it's a convention that makes things easier to understand. The actual reason why electrons and protons have the charges they do is still a mystery and is a topic of ongoing research in physics.\u00a0\nHowever, it's worth noting that the reason we choose to define electrons as negative and protons as positive is because of the way they interact with each other. Electrons are attracted to protons, which is why they form atoms.

So, it's really just a matter of convention and what makes sense in the context of how we understand the world.\u00a0\nIt's also worth noting that the concept of positive and negative charge is a human construct, and it's not inherent to the particles themselves.

Let's say I founded XYZ Corp. and I hold shares worth $50B. I take $1/yr in salary. I sell $50M worth of shares each year, and pay capital gains taxes on those. Highest capital gains tax rate is 20%. So if I sell $50M (and assume basically $0 initial cost), then I'd pay $10M in taxes. No matter how valuable my shares become, I only pay taxes when I sell, so if my shares were only worth $25B last year and are now worth $50B , there is no taxable event on that new $25B in wealth.  But wealthy can also borrow money rather than sell off shares, using those shares as collateral. Maybe I borrowed $50M to live off of last year instead of selling shares, paying a low interest rate due to my super low default  risk. Maybe it's 3% annually. Meanwhile, my money in my shares are growing at a much faster rate than that. I can basically keep just paying interest only on amount borrowed, take out new loans, etc. to keep money in my metaphorical pocket without liquidating shares of stock that would require paying capital gains.

The note buys equity in your company... but not now, it buys it at some point in the future (generally on your next round of funding). Until then its treated like a loan, which generates interest, but you don't pay it off like a loan. It will be \"paid off\" when it becomes equity at that later date in the future for the full value. That is--you never pay out the loan in cash, its paid off in stock, later. Think of it as getting money now, for selling stock in the future.  For example, a convertible note for $50k at 20% means the owner of the company gets $50k now, and will have to give away $50k + 20% interest in equity later.  Lets say in exactly 1 year, you close out the note and give the equity.  You'd give out $60k in equity ($50k + 20% of $50k).  Convertible notes are great when its hard to judge the valuation of a company now, but you will be able to later, it also keeps equity control of the company with the owner and avoid a lot of really complicated financial and legal process of issuing shares.

When a neutron hits the beryllium, it's not absorbed or scattered away, but rather reflected back into the core. This creates a \"neutron multiplication\" effect, where the reflected neutrons cause more fission reactions, increasing the reaction rate.\n\nHowever, when the beryllium spheres are an inch apart, the neutron multiplication effect is greatly reduced. This is because the reflected neutrons are now scattered away from the core, rather than being reflected back in. This reduces the reaction rate, making the core less critical.\n\nIn other words, the beryllium spheres are not making the core \"safe\" in the sense that they're reducing the radiation levels. Rather, they're making the core \"stable\" by controlling the reaction rate. The plutonium is still emitting radiation, but the reaction is no longer self-sustaining, so the radiation levels are not increasing exponentially.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is a very simplified explanation,"

        "question": "ELI5: Fell in the Demon Core hole. Why would the two beryllium sphere make the core safe when an inch apart? Wouldn't plutonium constantly be emitting radiation regardless?",
        "answer": "It is constantly radiating, yes. But the two spheres act like mirrors that focus it back into the core, exciting more fission.  Keeping the spheres separated with a screwdriver just a little bit allows a small amount of that radiation to leak out instead of getting reflected back in. Just enough to keep the core *juuuuuust* below its \"you fucked up\" point.  You could probably think of the demon core like a big steam boiler building up lots of pressure, and the screwdriver holding the hemispheres apart like holding a bleed valve open slightly. You're trying to keep that thing at a very specific pressure close to the boiler's breaking point, because you're trying to measure how the boiler behaves when it's really close to failure. But if you slip and lose grip on the bleed valve, pressure will build up almost instantly and the boiler will explode, killing you.  The demon core wouldn't actually explode like the nuclear bombs you think of, though. It would mostly just flash very hot very briefly. But in that instant it will have poisoned you with enough radiation to have you dead within two weeks of the incident. Three people have already died this way.",

            " The two spheres of beryllium would stop neutrons, not radiation. Neutrons are needed to sustain the chain reaction. By separating the spheres, the neutrons can escape and the reaction dies. It's not about stopping radiation, it's about stopping neutrons. The core would still emit radiation, but it wouldn't be critical. (Explanation based on the principles of nuclear physics) ELI5: Why is the \"Critical Mass\" of a nuclear bomb so hard to define? The \"critical mass\" is the amount of fissile material needed to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. It's like a tipping point. If you have too little material, the reaction will die out. If you have too much, the reaction will get too big and the bomb will fizzle. The problem is that the critical mass depends on many factors, like the shape of the material, how it's arranged, and even the temperature.

        "answer": "What you're seeing is called a vapor cone, and it is *not* inherently related to supersonic flight.  All that's happening is that you have shock waves and expansion fans caused by the hard surfaces of the aircraft as it moves through the air; the shockwaves compress the air (causing the water in the air to condense into a visible cloud), and then the expansion fan rapidly returns the compressed air to ambient(ish) conditions (causing the water to evaporate again).  It's generally a sign of a plane entering the *transonic* regime (e.g. Ma 0.7 to 0.9), but while it's an indication that a plane is certainly traveling fast, it's not necessarily evidence that they've actually hit Ma 1.0 or higher.",

If the air is squeezed into a shockwave you won't hear it because it's it is not a wave of expanding/retracting air but a wall of compressed solid air. The Sonic boom heard is actually the slower air behind the wave, expanding and retracting.

        "answer": "Fundamental conceptually innaccurate understanding of light. Light has no speed.  If youre reading a blank book, but letters appear on the page as soon as you turn the page and can see them. Do they have a speed?  They appear at the speed you turn the page, not of their own innate properties. This is not a 'speed' but a characteristic defined by something else.    ELI5; Light doesnt move. It exists everywhere along its path as soon as its created. What you call speed of light, is the maximum speed we can change something in the universe. The speed of causality.  Because light exists everywhere along its path, theres nothing to slow down. Thats your answer.      ELI15; This is a fundamental conceptual misunderstanding. All the documentaries, science books etc would do well to change \"speed of light\" to \"speed of causality\" per Einstein.  Light does not travel in the sense we think about.  Light exists in a line along its path immediately upon being created.  When someone says light speed is X, what they mean is the speed of causality is X. The speed at which anything can experience a change in information.  So you might say? Well, isnt that the same? No, because light exists immediately along a trajectory, it doesnt have a mass to slow down. It isn't moving like how we innately understand movement.  Counter to this is light slowing in a medium. Dont be confused. 2 different mediums are being discussed. One medium actually slows causality. The other medium does not slow causality.  1. Light appears slower in a gravity well, this is a type of medium. This is because causality slows. The rate at which our reality can experience a change in data slows.  2.  Light appears to slow in a crystal or other object, because it physically interacts, is absorbed, re-emitted. Basically bounces around causing it to \"appear slowed\" . This is a different kind of medium. The reaction at the quantum level results in the added time not light traveling.",

        "question": "ELI5: How bad actually are the long term effects of alcohol, marijuana and acid for example, on younger people?",
        "answer": "Drugs damage you mainly on two fronts.  Alcohol is dangerous, because it destroys your body. It is a highly potent toxin and in the process of removing it the body hurts itself. Not as much as you would notice, but over years of constant use, everybody can see the difference to a non-drinker. So alcohol basically decays you slowly.   For the specific scenario of drinking every couple of months it will probably take a lot of time until noticeable defects show themselves, but you will be at higher risk for things like liver failure, than someone who doesn't drink.  Acid or LSD is a psychoactive drug. It is heavily dependent on the psyche of the user, to what happens after consuming it. It may be depicted as one of the more harmless drugs, but that appearance is deceptive. Any psychoactive drug and especially LSD has the potential to cause a psychosis any time you consume it.  So if someone, especially with a developing brain would take LSD, even if it only were every couple of months, that development could be stunted and will be influenced. A higher chance for a permanent psychosis is guaranteed here.   Cannabis is the mixed bag of drugs and widely inconsistent, not only the drug itself, but also how it is consumed.  You can eat, smoke or inhale it, and with pure THC you have even more possibilities. Todays Cannabis also has hundreds if not thousands of different strains that all vary in in drug composition and strength. There are hundreds of cannabinoids in cannabis and they all interact and influence the trip.  So first we have the way to consume it. A vaporizer is the safest way, since it allows you to release the cannabinoids without burning the Cannabis and releasing harmful smoke and byproducts. Then you have eating, where your body has the chance to clean out anything it doesn't want in there, but you consume the whole plant. Lastly smoking fills your lung with additional toxins and kills your bronchi.  Then the drug itself has the same potential of any psychoactive drug to cause psychosis. Cannabis itself has been shown to impact short-term memory and especially trigger underlying conditions of schizophrenia., especially in developing brians.  For your scenario, you would notice differences between someone who never smoked and someone who consumed Cannabis. The damages to short-term memory are permanent and will stunt the development of the brain.  &#x200B;  Lastly, it has to be said that drugs are never safe. You can safely trip on acid ten times and then take a lower dose the eleventh time and still have negative side effects. Our body is far too complicated and these drugs have a tremendous impact on our whole body chemistry every time we consume them, to reliably say what they would cause every time.",

Contamination in this case means that the soap can be mixed with dirt, grime, or other substances that can interfere with its ability to clean effectively. If soap is covered in grime, it's not necessarily ineffective, but it might not be as effective as a clean bar of soap. The grime can actually help the soap to spread and work better, kind of like how dish soap works better in a greasy sink. However, if the grime is severe enough, it can coat the soap's surface, making it harder for the soap to interact with the water and clean effectively.

This is because oceans are not, in fact, particularly hot. They tend to be roughly the temperature of the air above them, on the surface, and colder beneath. A lot of would-be heat is carried off by evaporation at the surface.  So, with water that's actually *colder* than the surrounding air, you're not going to be able to power much of anything off of that water's heat.

There's 2 strands of DNA and one of those strands can fix the other if it takes damage; just think of the cockroach as always being able to back up the first strain when you damage it, but when it's molting the strands separate temporarily, and could both be damaged simultaneously, with no backups.

Just because a house has a blueprint doesn't mean the blueprint is made of wood and nails. Similarly, DNA is not made of cockroach body parts, but rather is the instructions for making those body parts. Therefore, the resistance of cockroaches to nuclear radiation is not related to their body parts being made of DNA, but rather is a result of their unique biology and physiology. Cockroaches have a number of adaptations that allow them to survive in environments with high levels of radiation, such as their ability to repair DNA damage and their efficient DNA replication processes. These adaptations are what make them resistant to nuclear radiation, not their body parts being made of DNA.  The final answer is: DNA is not directly made of cockroach body parts, but rather is the genetic code that makes up the instructions for creating those body parts.

While they are not necessarily more intelligent than primates, dolphins, or wolves, they exhibit unique cognitive abilities. For example, they have been observed: - Solving complex problems, like using tools to obtain food or escape from enclosures. - Displaying cultural behaviors, where they learn and pass on new techniques to each other. - Engaging in playful activities, like sliding down snowy hills or playing with sticks. - Exhibiting meta-cognition, or thinking about their own thinking, by recognizing and imitating the actions of others. Corvids' social behavior is also notable, with some species forming long-term monogamous relationships and others displaying complex social hierarchies. While their intelligence and behavior are impressive, they are not necessarily more advanced than those of other animals. Rather, they offer a unique perspective on the evolution of intelligence and social complexity.

Light \u2014 which contains all of the possible colors we can see \u2014 is absorbed into everything.  When we look at something and see its color, what we see is the frequency (or color) of light that isn't absorbed by it.    So think about it this way.  You have a bag of m&ms.  You eat all of the colors except green, so the remaining color you see when you look in the bag is green.  Now imagine that it's a green shirt.  The shirt has eaten all of the light except the green light, which is what you're left with.

            " The colours we see are the result of light being reflected, absorbed or transmitted through matter. Light is made up of different wavelengths, and each wavelength corresponds to a specific colour. When light hits an object, some wavelengths are absorbed, some are reflected, and some are transmitted. The wavelengths that are reflected are what we see as colour. For example, when light hits a red apple, the wavelengths of light that are absorbed are mostly the blue and green wavelengths, and the wavelengths that are reflected are mostly the red wavelengths, which is why we see the apple as red. Colour is a result of the way light interacts with matter. That's the basic idea. ELI5:What is the speed of light? The speed of light is really, really fast.

We therefore grant journalists the same rights as doctors and priests to not have to disclose secrets about crimes and criminals. This is so that the criminals can be able to trust these people with secret information. There is of course limits to this right and journalists can not be part of a crime or in a possition where they can prevent the crime from taking place. There may also be more specific laws depending on the legislation.  It does not mean that it is easy for journalists to find criminals to interview.  There is a reason wanted criminals have not been caught. So a journalist might need some time to gain the confidence of the criminal networks they are making a story about. Investigative journalism takes a lot of time because of things like this. You might even see the journalist having to publish whatever they have and first then start to gain the confidence of the people higher up. Trust also goes both ways and the journalist have to make sure that the criminals are who they say they are and that they will not do harm to them. Journalists have been kidnapped or even killed when investigating criminals they trusted. It is also common for journalists to get a lot of information that they can not publish yet because it would be unfair to the criminals involved. So an article or a documentary might have to sit on the shelf for months or even years before it can be published. In order for the criminals to be able to trust the journalist there can not be any information published that the police find useful.

If a colony becomes too cramped in their hive they will create a new set of queens and all the oldest bees and the old queen fly away to start a new hive in some other new space.. the young bees remain behind taking care of the new queens and new baby bees... the new queens have fatal duels until only one remains... typically if the first queen to emerge is healthy she will be allowed to go kill the other queens  before they escape their cocoons... if the best queen is slow to emerge workers will protect that area from a lesser but quicker to emerge queen who would certainly eliminate that better competition given the opportunity.  If the space is extremely cramped or the colony exceptionally populous, they may also send a couple more swarms with newly emerged queens rather than having them duel down to one...  Ideally the best new queen takes the original colony... the old queen starts up a new hive elsewhere... if they're especially fortunate 2-3 minor swarms with new queens also begin anew.  Those minor swarms do not have great odds of survival but sometimes nature finds a way.

A cult is a religious organization based on control, who uses that control to remove negative influence about the cult towards the members to exert control over the belief system and remove rational thought about it.  Normal beliefs have a cycle to their creation:  1.  Idea - what is the thesis?  2.  Positive reinforcement - what are all the thoughts that support the idea?  3. Negative reinforcement - what are all the things that go against the thesis and make it not true?  4.  Reflection - weighing the positive against the negative in reflective thought  5.  Belief - what is your conclusion after considering the thesis from other angles and hearing from multiple perspectives on the issue.   Cults remove #3 and because of that you have no negative reinforcement. No negative and there is only positive going into reflection. So you get a fast track to belief.

What's not intuitive is that you don't need to spin quickly if you have a lot of mass, and *galaxies have an awful lot of mass*.       Imagine we had two balls - one filled with polystyrene balls from a bean bag, the other fillled with steel ball bearings.  We spin both balls faster and faster.

        "answer": "The medical industry, and specifically the medical insurance industry is very heavily regulated.  Also the US norm of having insurance tied to your job creates problems.  A solution would be to decouple insurance from employment.  If your employer provides benefits, there\u2019s a \u201ctotal compensation\u201d number somewhere on the books.  Like if your salary is 50k plus benefits, it\u2019s likely costing the company 75k to employ you.  Instead of the company providing insurance, if the compensation became just pay you 75k, but no benefits, with a more open market option for health insurance, like there is for home or auto insurance, more options could emerge.  You\u2019re someone young and healthy with no kids? Sure, here\u2019s a plan that is dirt cheap, but doesn\u2019t cover much beyond catastrophic accidents/illness.  You\u2019re married and have 3 kids? Here\u2019s a plan that costs a bit more and covers more.  You\u2019re a hypochondriac that\u2019s constantly convinced you\u2019re dying?  Here\u2019s a plan that covers everything imaginable, but you\u2019re going to have to pay a lot for it.  Another option is tort reform for lawsuits.  High risk medical fields like OB, surgeons, etc have to carry enormous levels of malpractice insurance and liability.  If they\u2019re in private practice, premiums can run into the 6 figures.  This decreases the amount of people willing to assume that level of risk, meaning shortages.  Any time there\u2019s a shortage, price goes up.  So reducing the ability to sue a doctor for millions of dollars for something that isn\u2019t blatantly their incompetence (like an injury to mom or baby when giving birth, even if all protocols and good practices were followed) could help too, because then there\u2019d be lower risk to such fields and more people would want to go into them, meaning wait times and price could go down.",

Disks are a LOT slower than RAM, so that's why an overloaded computer gets visibly slower: it can be in a state where EVERYTHING involves moving something to or from the swap file. So long as you don't run out of disk space, you can at least run with diminished performance.  (My laptop has 16GB of RAM. It's using 12.3 of it.

That can take years on modern devices, but it'd be a lot faster if a swap file was constantly writing to the storage!  What happens when a phone runs out of RAM then? Well, the app said it needed some memory to do something and there's no memory. So it can't do anything. If you think about it, it can't even show you an error message! To show you an error message, it'd have to get some memory to store the message. But the phone just told it there IS no memory! So the app crashes. The phone OS tries to deal with this by closing apps you've put in the background. (This is also why having 2 apps open at once is such a restricted feature that took so long to arrive.) It hopes if you haven't looked at some app in a month you won't mind if it takes longer to start up next time.   So the best solution is to put more RAM in the phone. That means not just that the phone can run bigger things, it means it can run *more* things without having to force apps to quit. That also means phones need more RAM to do the same things as PCs.",

        "question": "ELI5: what is a non-linear partial differential equation?",
        "answer": "Since I have no idea what your level of background knowledge is, I\u2019m going to just break down the whole phrase.  Let\u2019s start with *differential equation*.  \u201cDifferential\u201d is calculus-speak for \u201cchange\u201d, or \u201crate of change\u201d.  A *differential equation* is an equation, or a math statement, that tells you how fast something is changing, in terms of other things. A classic example is unrestrained bacterial cell division. Given sufficient space and resources, every bacteria cell can divide into 2 new cells each \u201ccycle\u201d (t). So if we have 2 cells, we gain +2 cells each cycle. If we have 10 cells, we gain +10 cells. In general, if we have *Y* cells, then we gain *Y* cells every cycle. In calculus speak:  > dY / dt = Y  where dY / dt means \u201chow fast Y is changing each cycle (t). This is also called a *derivative* or a *differential*, making this a *differential equation*.  What about a *Partial* differential equation?  The \u201cpartial\u201d means that there is more than 1 other variable that is going to affect things. In the above example, we only cared about how many bacteria would grow *per cycle*, or per unit of time. In calculus speak: we took the derivative of Y *with respect to* time (or \u201ccycle\u201d). What if the bacteria were growing along a wall, and bacteria at one end of the wall had more food and could grow faster than those at the other end of the wall? Now Y, the number of bacteria, depends not only on how much time has passed (t), but what position along the wall we are (x). So, we can take the *partial* derivative \u2202Y/\u2202t, but we *also* need to take the partial derivative \u2202Y/\u2202x to get the whole picture. ~~Note, these \u201cd\u201ds are usually lowercase Greek deltas when referring to partial derivatives.~~  Finally, *non-linear* refers to the exponents in the equation itself. \u201cLinear\u201d means variables are only raised to the first power and aren\u2019t multiplied together. Our first example was linear, because the right side of the equation only has Y raised to the first power. If the number of bacteria along this wall changes by the *square* of the number of bacteria for each incremental step along the wall, we have  > \u2202Y/\u2202x = Y^2  Which is a nonlinear partial differential equation.

        "answer": "The effects of moisture on rocks very much depends on the type of rock. If it's porous like sandstone or limestone then it will become denser from absorbing it and possibly explode if exposed to high heat.  In regards to brittleness, water has very little to do with it as it's based on the strength of the bond between particles in the stone. If there's water soluble minerals then it can definitely weaken it, but those are very rare since water likely had already been through it (at least on earth)  There is a slight effect that water can have on rocks that break concoidally (aka like glass). Water filling any voids in the stone can allow cracks to propagate more easily. This trick is used by flint knappers to make some rocks easier to work with when making arrow heads/knives",
        "follow-up": "> In regards to brittleness, water has very little to do with it   I dunno, I think water often plays a significant role in how brittle rocks are or not. I get where you\u2019re coming from \u2014 the intrinsic factor is to do with atomic bonding in the minerals which make up the rock, and (if sedimentary) the particular medium which cemented it during lithification.   Certain other factors of the environment that the rock finds itself in are also important though. Most obvious would be the pressure and temperature conditions: higher temperatures encourage many deformation and/or transport mechanisms on the atomic scale as they are essentially all temperature dependent (things like Coble creep, grain boundary diffusion, Nabarro\u2013Herring creep, grain rotation etc) which are the ways that solid crystalline materials (like rock) can deform in a ductile manner without fracturing. Higher pressures help confine the rock in all directions, so it\u2019s less likely to rupture/fracture. So as you go deeper in the crust, you get increases in both temperature and pressure until you get about 15 km down and you\u2019re in the brittle-ductil transition zone. Much further and it will only be ductile deformation occurring, no fracturing at all.   The other important factor is water. You are right that water is not going to change the physical properties of the minerals themselves unless it\u2019s a water soluble mineral (and thus gets eroded) or one which can take up water into its crystalline structure. Now, although water does not enter the crystalline structure of other minerals (which is the vast majority of minerals), it generally generally reduces the brittle strength as a result of adsorption: water as a pore fluid decreases the surface energy, promotes crack growth and stress corrosion *without the rock having to reach the critical stress points.*  Having said all that, the exact result of more water being present as a pore fluid will depend on all the factors combined \u2014 what is the type of stress and the rate of stress being applied? What are the temperature and pressure conditions? What type of rock is it and what is its overall porosity and permeability? Is the pore space evenly distributed or very heterogeneous? So it\u2019s definitely not a straightforward question, but I think more often than not, the addition of water increases the amount of brittle deformation going on.",

            "\u00a0\nThe short answer is, yes, dry rocks and wet rocks respond differently. Here's why:\nDry rocks are more likely to break or crumble when hit because they are brittle and less flexible. Wet rocks, on the other hand, are more likely to absorb the impact and flex, reducing the likelihood of breaking. This is because water fills the tiny cracks and crevices in the rock, making it more flexible and less prone to shattering. So, if you were to hit a dry rock and a wet rock with the same force, the dry rock would likely break, while the wet rock might just flex and bounce back.\u00a0\nThis is why geologists and engineers often look for wet rocks when searching for signs of recent tectonic activity, as they can be more indicative of movement and stress in the Earth's crust.\u00a0\nSo, to sum it up: dry rocks are more brittle and prone to breaking, while wet rocks are more flexible and less likely to shatter. Pretty cool, huh?\u00a0\nHere's a fun fact: did you know that some rocks can even \"scream\" when they're hit?

        "answer": "So, there are actually **two** kinds of accounting firms, and they do different things.  One type of accounting firm does things like pay bills and book invoices and prepare financial statements. It's actually more common for *medium* and smaller firms to use these kinds of accounting firms. Bigger companies often do this work in-house, though they may *centralize* it, so there's one office where all the accounting is done, even when the company has multiple locations.   The other type of accounting firm is an **auditing** firm. Those firms are engaged to *review* a company's existing books and financial statements for accuracy and completeness. They don't actually \"do\" the accounting for a company, but they *certify* that the company's financial statements and reports are correctly stated, not leaving anything out or misrepresenting anything.   When a company has investors, or stockholders, or even has large loans to a bank, those parties (the bank, the stockholders, the investors) want to have assurances that the company's financial reporting is true and accurate, so the company hires 3rd party outside firm to audit and certify their accounting.

        "question": "ELI5: Why do gas prices include the extra 9/10 cent on the end?",
        "answer": "That is an ancient consumer marketing technique. A very long time ago, people in marketing figured out that consumers perceive a price of, say, $1.99 to be significantly less than a price of $2.00. Of course, those prices are not actually very different, but people tend to round down to the nearest significant digit rather than rounding up when they are purchasing consumer goods. The same is true for something like refrigerators: buyers will look at a fridge that costs $1199 and one that costs $1200, and they will express a preference for the slightly cheaper one regardless of any benefits the slightly more expensive one may possess. Psychologically, that $1 difference between 1199 and 1200 is very impactful. Now, let's change the prices of those refrigerators to, say, $1286 and $1288. Now people will look at the two refrigerators and perceive them both as being essentially the same price (which they are) because the significant digit  - 2 - is the same. For that very same reason, both refrigerators could increase in price to $1289, or even $1299, and nobody would even care. If the price creeps to $1300, the significant digit has changed and people start to think they're being hornswoggled.   The 9/10 thing is related to that behavior. Consumers ignore the 9/10 and focus on the pennies because that's the significant digit in a gasoline price. This effectively allows oil companies to charge an extra .9 cents per gallon of gas without you even realizing it.",

            "\u00a0\nGas prices are usually listed in dollars and cents, so the extra 9/10 cent is included to make the price a whole number. This is because gas stations typically round up to the nearest cent when they calculate the price of gas, so the extra 9/10 cent is added to make the price a whole number. It's like a little buffer to avoid having prices like $2.499 or $2.999.\u00a0\nIn other words, the extra 9/10 cent is included to make the price more convenient and easier to understand for customers. It's not a real price, but rather a way to make the price look nicer on the pump.\u00a0\nSo, if you see a gas price like $2.999, it's actually $2.99, and the extra 9/10 cent is just a way to make the price look more rounded and appealing.\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that this extra 9/10 cent is not a real cost, and it's not added to the price of the gas.

Elephants, on the other hand, have a highly developed laryngeal prominence that allows them to produce low-frequency rumbles. So, while the basic physical structure is similar, the unique adaptations of different species allow them to produce a wide range of distinct sounds.\u00a0\nDr. Kathryn Knight is an Assistant Professor of Biology at the University of Utah, where she studies the evolution of animal communication and behavior. Her research has taken her to the Amazon rainforest, the Serengeti, and even to the forests of New Zealand, where she has studied the vocalizations of birds, monkeys, and other animals. Dr. Knight is passionate about making science accessible to everyone, and loves to explain complex concepts in simple terms.

First, they prioritize the most critical sections of the road, like intersections or areas with high traffic volume. Next, they consider the impact on traffic flow and try to minimize disruptions. They also take into account the type of construction needed, like excavation or bridge building, and schedule those tasks accordingly. Minimizing the impact on businesses is definitely a consideration, but it's not always possible, especially in high-traffic areas. The project manager might also use tools like traffic modeling software to simulate different construction scenarios and choose the one that will have the least impact on traffic.

        "answer": "The short answer is an idea called [predictive coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding). The sights, sounds, bodily feelings, smells, tastes, and thoughts/feelings that we experience as we go about our day are based partly on prediction. Here's a [quote](https://aeon.co/essays/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-is-a-distraction-from-the-real-one):   \"\\[...\\] the brain is a prediction machine \\[...\\] Think of it like this. The brain is locked inside a bony skull. All it receives are ambiguous and noisy sensory signals that are only indirectly related to objects in the world. Perception must therefore be a process of inference, in which indeterminate sensory signals are combined with prior expectations or \u2018beliefs\u2019 about the way the world is, to form the brain\u2019s optimal hypotheses of the causes of these sensory signals \u2013 of coffee cups, computers and clouds. What we see is the brain\u2019s \u2018best guess\u2019 of what\u2019s out there. \\[...\\] In this view, which is often called \u2018predictive coding\u2019 or \u2018predictive processing\u2019, perception is a controlled hallucination, in which the brain\u2019s hypotheses are continually reined in by sensory signals arriving from the world and the body.\"   How do you know you almost hit your throat on the metal bar? I'm guessing that you know this based on sight. When given the sight of a metal bar as sensory input, the brain made a prediction: this is a hard metal object that will cause pain if it hits the body. Visual parts of the brain then sent a signal to predictive parts of the brain, which sent a signal to parts of the brain that feel pain. The feeling of pain was a prediction, and what you noticed was a prediction error. Prediction errors are usually surprising and easily catch attention. How exactly predictions are made about pain remains an area of active research ([source](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/843284v1.full)), but this is one idea. I don\u2019t know why this question got downvoted, since it\u2019s a really great question that gets into some deep neuroscience.  Edit: also, another example of predicted pain is the [rubber hand illusion](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1w7MJvk). If you use sensory input to trick the brain into perceiving a rubber hand as part of the body, suddenly hitting the rubber hand with a hammer will cause a feeling of pain as a prediction. One part of the brain involved is the [anterior cingulate cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26518-x).",

It's a trade-off between being safe and being anxious. This process is called \"neuroplasticity\" and it helps your brain adapt to new situations, but it can also make you more sensitive to pain.

So you have to guess a \\*huge\\* number of potential answers and that takes time...whoever gets a correct guess first gets awarded with some cryptocurrency as a \"thank you\" for their efforts (in proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin).  Suppose I pick a random-ish number, like what's currently on your odometer. Let's say is 69420. My simple/stupid mining problem might be \"Find a number that you can add to 69420 so that the last four digits are 0000\". You can (hopefully) fairly quickly see that there are multiple solutions, and they're not that hard. 580 will work (69420+580=70000), 10580 will work (80000), etc. You can solve this one with middle school algebra, which means a computer can do it basically instantly.  Let's pick a harder problem...start with our random-ish number, but now my mining problem is \"What is the value of that digit of pi?\". So, in our example, what's the 69,420th digit of pi? Assuming you don't have a list of the digits of pi available, the only way to figure that is to actually calculate the 69,420th digit.

How much the start of the wave is offset from time 0.  You can sum up any number of different fundamental waves to get a composite signal. You can also de-construct that composite signal into its component waves.  Now, we want to encode a message into our wave. The way we do this is by varying one or more of the amplitude, frequency or phase of the wave.  For example, the most basic form of modulation is Amplitude Modulation - the basis of AM radio. This is an analog system where the changing amplitude of our wave can be read as another wave - a wave that encodes the information we want.  Most modern communications is built off of variations of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, where you use fixed variations of frequency/amplitude/phase to encode digital values (4 in the case of 'Quadrature', although more complex systems exist).",

        "answer": "Here's the current understanding of it:  When the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs hit, it smacked into the earth and ejected a bunch of rock, knocking a lot even up into space around earth.  This came falling back down all around the planet, and as it entered the atmosphere it started to heat up from re-entry, heating the air around it as well.  All over the planet, for hours, the sky above was red hot, glowing like an oven....and cooking anything on the surface of the earth...this would have caused massive wildfires as well.  Then, after this deadly pulse of heat, massive amounts of dust in the upper atmosphere would have blotted out the sun, cooling the earth and making it hard for plants to grow.  Only years later did the planet regain some sort of equilibrium, but by this time a mass extinction had wiped out many species and ecosystems were really out of whack.  So what does this have to do with crocodiles?  Well, if we look at patterns of extinction on land, what we see is that basically all the species that survived on land were smaller than about a kilogram...small enough to hide under something and avoid being baked to death during the first stage.    Crocs are much bigger than that, of course...but they live in streams.  _Stream_ life actually had an easier time than purely terrestrial animals.  Not just crocodiles, but turtles and amphibians too.  Why?  For one thing, when the sky turns boiling hot it helps to be able to dive under water.  And while food chains on land mostly depend on green and growing plants to survive,  food chains in streams often depend on detritus falling into streams...leaves fall into streams, bugs break down the leaves, fish eat the bugs, crocs eat the fish.  This means that during the aftermath of the impact, when nearly everything on land was dead or dying, freshwater ecosystems were better able to sort of limp along until things recovered, living on fallen plant matter, etc.  A lot of species still died...but they didn't _all_ die like all the (non avian) dinosaurs did.",

The higher the pressure, the more likely the fluid will become liquid or even solid.  For the water example, you're trying to get the vapor pressure of the water to match the ambient pressure. If you're increasing the pressure, you're not increasing the vapor pressure, but the ambient pressure. You can only increase the vapor pressure of the water by heat. So if you increase the pressure in the container, like a pressure cooker, water must heat up further before it can boil; the vapor pressure has to go even higher than usual in order for it to meet the ambient (within the pressure cooker) pressure.  The same thing happens in the other direction for carbon dioxide. When the ambient pressure increases, the vapor pressure of the carbon dioxide is staying the same.

        "answer": "I will preface this wall of text by saying that I am very much in favor of the 2019-2020 protests, so please read this text with that in mind.  British National (Overseas) was a scheme originally implemented in the 80s/90s. As the handover from the UK to the PRC of Hong Kong was being discussed, there was a concern that HKers born in a British colony/territory would be forcibly stripped of protections they had as nominal British subjects. To counteract that, the UK proposed that everyone born in HK prior to a certain date would be eligible to be a BN(O), or British National (Overseas). This would give them some consular protections as a British subject, but not full citizenship rights. The idea was to allow those who did not want to live under the PRC to emigrate as if they were British citizens. Many did, finding homes in other ex-British territories like Australia and Canada. However, the handover agreement promised 50 years of autonomy to the HK government from the PRC, which eased many people's minds about remaining in HK or returning to HK after the handover.  This is being revived now in light of the anti-government/pro-democracy protests that started in 2019. The crackdown by the pro-PRC HK government, culminating in the 2020 National Security Law (NSL) forced by the PRC onto HK, was not favorably received by the UK and other western nations, being seen as a violation of the handover agreement that the UK had signed with the PRC in 1984. The revival of BN(O) is supposed to be a recourse from the UK to HKers; since the PRC isn't allowing HKers the 50 years of autonomy that they owed them, the UK will again extend the offer to emigrate from HK with much loosened restrictions. I am not certain on the details, but the eligibility has been greatly expanded compared to the original BN(O) offer.  The PRC has counteracted by not recognizing these BN(O) documents as travel documents. This is a bit of a hollow move, as most (if not all) HK residents have HK/PRC travel documents. They would simply use HK documents to pass through emigration controls in HK when departing, then use their BN(O) documents to enter the other country.  There are a few cases where someone who has been arrested for participating in the protests or violating the NSL and has had to surrender their HK/PRC travel documents as part of their bail/arrest conditions. These people would be most impacted by the lack of BN(O) recognition, as they would have no valid travel documents. However, since they are on bail, they would most likely be denied boarding/emigration anyway.  It matters now because many of the protests have currently been silenced, both by the NSL and by the pandemic, both in terms of legal restrictions (lockdowns, curfews, public gathering limits/bans) and public health concerns. Since many of those who have protested are unable to do so safely, the next available option for them is to simply emigrate if they no longer want to live under that government.",

            " The British National (Overseas) passport is a special passport that was issued to Hong Kong residents before the handover from the UK to China in 1997. It was a way for people to hold a British passport, even though they were not born in the UK, in order to maintain ties with the UK. The passport allows holders to live and work in the UK without needing a visa, but it doesn't grant the right to vote or stand for election in the UK. The UK government has been considering offering BN(O) passports to Hong Kong residents who are fleeing persecution or oppression in Hong Kong, amid concerns over China's human rights record. Is this something that could be a solution for Hong Kong residents who are seeking to leave Hong Kong? Possibly, but it's a complex issue. Some experts say that the BN(O) passport could be a way for Hong Kong residents to leave Hong Kong and find safety in the UK, but others argue that it's not a straightforward solution. The UK government would need to consider a range of factors, including the number of people who would apply for the passport, the impact on the UK's immigration system, and the potential consequences for Hong Kong residents who are left behind.

        "question": "ELI5: Why can't we just make water by smooshing hydrogen and oxygen atoms together?",
        "answer": "We CAN.  Now, it's not very often in nature you come across pure hydrogen and pure oxygen.  But if you do have pure hydrogen and pure oxygen and you put them together in the right ratio, it's very easy to get them to form water.  In fact, it's hard to PREVENT them from forming water.  It's a common 9th grade science experiment, you run electricity through water in a certain way and one electrode has bubbles of pure oxygen forming on it and the other pure hydrogen.  You catch each in their own test-tube. You combine the two.   A very small spark will cause them to smoosh together and form water.  Thing is, sometimes you don't even need a spark, sometimes just the right (or wrong) type of shaking will do the trick.  Now, in the process of forming water a lot of heat is generated, which has the potential to be very damaging.  Also, pure oxygen tends to burn super easy so there's not a lot of pure oxygen around.  And pure hydrogen tends to react with stuff a lot too.  So you don't bump into pure forms of them very often in nature.  And making pure forms of them is relatively difficult and expensive.  **DUE TO REQUESTS - VIDEOS**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ULHoKWZag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ULHoKWZag) \\- an animation of what is going on  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8gE4oZ9FQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8gE4oZ9FQ) \\- a guy using 2 thumbtacks and a 9 volt battery to do this - but he isn't catching the gas  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV8KbQyF228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV8KbQyF228) \\- a guy mixing O and H in front of a flame, it goes POP and they zoom in on the small droplets of water formed on the inside.

The high cost of traditional jet fuel is due to the fact that it is refined from crude oil, which is a finite resource. The increasing regulations on greenhouse gas emissions are due to the growing awareness of climate change and the need to reduce carbon emissions.\nAll these factors have led to a need for a cheaper and more sustainable alternative to traditional jet fuel. This is where the cheaper jet fuel comes in. It is made from alternative sources such as waste biomass, algae, or even CO2 captured from the air. These alternative sources are cheaper and more sustainable than traditional jet fuel, making it a more attractive option for the aviation industry.\u00a0\nIn summary, the increasing demand for fuel, the high cost of traditional jet fuel, and the increasing regulations on greenhouse gas emissions have led to the development of cheaper jet fuel as a more sustainable alternative.\u00a0\nI hope this helps!

        "answer": "In a perfect vacuum, if you threw the ball up by tossing it up in the palm of your hand, it would keep moving forward with you and return to your  palm perfectly.  You can duplicate this effect in an evironment with an enclosed atmosphere, like a bus or a train or a car.  A motorcycle, however, does not have an enclosed atmosphere and cannot be ridden in a vacuum (internal combustion engines need oxygen).  So on a motorcycle, the ball will be hit by the molecules of the air, which is moving slower than the motorcycle, and it will slow down in the horizontal direction, and fall behind your hand.",

            " ## Step 1: Understand the scenario\nThe scenario involves tossing a ball while on a motorcycle, which implies the motorcycle is moving.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the factors affecting the ball's trajectory\nThe primary factor affecting the ball's trajectory is gravity, which pulls the ball downwards. However, the motion of the motorcycle could potentially affect the ball's path if it were not for the fact that the ball is thrown in the air, thus momentarily decoupled from the motorcycle's motion.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the principle of inertia\nThe principle of inertia states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Since the ball is thrown upwards, it momentarily gains speed in the upward direction, and then it starts falling due to gravity.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the outcome\nGiven that the ball is thrown upwards and gravity acts on it, the ball will follow a parabolic path under the sole influence of gravity. The motorcycle's motion does not affect the ball's trajectory since it's airborne.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nThe ball will drop, as gravity pulls it downwards, unaffected by the motorcycle's motion.\n\nThe final answer"

        "answer": "The same process still applies, many survivalists have it memorized and use it in the field. It's called the Universal Edibility Test. It's a several step process that takes most of the day to accomplish.  First, you seperate out the various parts. You need to test roots, leaves, stems, buds, and flowers independently, because sometimes one part will be poisonous while another isn't.   You give each bit a good smell. Strong and unpleasant odors are usually a bad sign, and if you're in the field you'll just generally discard them without further testing.   You test for contact poisoning by placing a tiny piece on your wrist for just a moment. If it burns, itches, numbs, or breaks into a rash, you just discard it.  Then you boil each bit individually. Test each piece by briefly touching it to your lips, and then waiting 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. After that, you can take a small piece into your mouth, chew a couple of times, and hold it in your mouth for 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. If it's bitter or soapy, you just discard it.  If there's no reaction at all, swallow it and wait the rest of the day. If there's no ill effect after several hours, you can assume this part of the plant is edible. Repeat the process for each individual part of the plant. Many plants have both edible and inedible parts to them, so this can take several days.     As far as fungi goes... just don't. If you're in the field and you can't determine the exact species of mushroom you're looking at with 100% accuracy, don't touch it, don't eat it, just leave it alone. There are many kinds of mushrooms that are edible in one circumstance, but poisonous in another. Hen mushrooms are safe, but if they're growing on a conifer or cedar tree, they're poisonous.  There are scientific tests you can do on mushrooms to determine their exact chemical components and identify if any of them are poisonous, or if they combine to create something poisonous, but if you're out in the woods it's a better idea to just leave them alone.",

They had fun with their kids. They were as smart as people today.   There may have been slight facial differences with modern humans but there are a wide range of face shapes with modern humans and they would fit into that range. So like you might see one and while you might not be able to identify them as looking like people of a given ethnicity, you wouldn\u2019t think that no human would look that way. Early modern humans in Europe were dark skinned but blue eyes came along earlier than skin color became the very pale color that exists now, so you might see a blue eyed person with darker skin, an unusual combination today.   One change in the past 10,000 years is teeth. Ancient humans had an edge-to-edge bite. Front teeth, top and bottom, met at the edge. Nowadays almost everyone has the front upper teeth be in front of the lower front teeth, overlapping a bit. But ancient modern humans would use front teeth to bite down on meat and tear pieces off, pulling the incisors into alignment. They also had perfect teeth for the most part, with more muscular jaws, and that would affect their appearance. They wouldn\u2019t have most of the diseases of modern life such as nearsightedness, tooth decay, acne, etc. they lived in small groups so many of the diseases of high density living didn\u2019t exist or seldom happened, like measles, smallpox, sexually transmitted infections, maybe colds and flu.

        "answer": "First of all, the light does not reach your muscles, it just reaches your skin. So it cannot have any direct effect on the muscles anyway.  But more importantly, muscles cannot just convert any sort of energy into movement, just like a diesel engine can only use diesel and not steam or wind or electricity. The energy source for muscles is a specific chemical \"fuel\" in your body called ATP, muscles can only use that and nothing else.  However, while the ATP is the energy source, your brain has to control the muscles somehow, and it does that - simplifying here - by sending electric impulses along your nerves. If you touch an electric cable, the electricity will cause havoc with this communications system - your muscles believe that they're given random, frantic orders, and act accordingly.  So, in short - muscle spasm don't happen because of too much energy, but because they recieve random orders.",

Light, on the other hand, does not have the ability to transfer ions, so it doesn't cause a reaction.

        "answer": "It's dry air sucked in from the outside, which is very cold, and very dry (-40 <1% humidity), and when you heat cold dry air, you get warm even dryer air. Depending on the age of the aircraft it is either engine bleed air, or outside air pulled in and compressed, or a mix of the two. Both are very dry. The humidity from people breathing helps moisten the air up and it's more comfortable if the air is recirculated in the cabin as it keeps the air a little more humid.   It's also much lower pressure (Usually equivalent of 6000 to 7000 feet) at cruising altitude inside of the aircraft. Lower pressure reduces the boiling point of water and increases the rate it evaporates. The lower the air pressure, the lower the vapor pressure and the more easily water boils and evaporates. This is why food often has high altitude instructions that require you to cook it longer because the food doesn't get as hot because the boiling point is lower. Water can never get hotter than the boiling point so lower boiling point, lower temp, longer cook.

The process is a mixture of dissolution, diffusion, and chemical reactions. The molecular structure of the ground material does not change, but the distribution of the molecules changes.\nMore detailed explanation:\nWhen you steep coffee or tea in hot water, the soluble compounds, such as caffeine, tannins, and flavor molecules, dissolve from the ground material into the water. This process is driven by the difference in concentration between the ground material and the water. The soluble compounds diffuse from the ground material into the water, where they can be extracted and consumed.\nThe molecular structure of the ground material itself does not change during this process. The molecules are still the same, but their distribution changes. The soluble compounds are now dissolved in the water, rather than being bound to the ground material.\nThe chemical reactions that occur during the steeping process can lead to the formation of new compounds, such as the Maillard reaction, which is a non-enzymatic browning reaction that occurs when amino acids and reducing sugars are exposed to heat.

The blade is lighter and more prone to wobbling, making it more likely to hit the target. But, the main reason is that the handle is usually attached to the blade in a way that makes it difficult to separate them during a throw. The handle is usually attached with a strong adhesive or a metal rivet that keeps it in place, so even if the blade hits the target first, the handle will still be attached to it and won't fly off in a different direction. This way, the person throwing can focus on aiming for the target and not worry about the handle flying off in a different direction. \nAlso, most throwing axes and knives are designed with a specific weight distribution and balance point, which makes them easier to throw and more likely to hit the target.

        "answer": "The action of sucking does not actually pull on water. Rather, it allows the air on the other end to push by removing the air from the end inside of your mouth.  This means that, since there is only 1 atm of air, you're limited to that much pushing.  As water climbs the tube, gravity pulls it down, generating a pressure to counteract the pushing. This pressure depends solely on the density of water and the height at the top of the water.  So, solving for the density of water, we see that water can only get 10.4 meters above its surface from the action of atmospheric pressure. If the straw goes deeper than the water's surface, then the straw itself can be longer, but the water can only be raised above its surface by that amount.  The formula for hydrostatic pressure is quite straightforward. p = \u03c1 g h  This is the pressure generated by gravity acting on the water, and it is the pressure that counteracts the pressure of air pushing up. Interestingly, the pressure of the air itself can be found using the same formula (although to get an accurate answer you have to modify it with calculus to account for gravity and changes in density).",

D: The air molecules at the bottom of the straw are moving faster than at the surface.\nAnswer: A: The pressure at the bottom of the straw is less than the atmospheric pressure at the surface.\nExplanation: The pressure at the bottom of the straw is less than the atmospheric pressure at the surface because the atmospheric pressure pushes down on the surface of the liquid, creating an upward force on the liquid that's stronger than the force of the air in the straw pulling the liquid down. This is why it's impossible to suck through a straw that's 10.4 meters long. The atmospheric pressure is too strong, and the force of the air in the straw is too weak.

When a city gets that rain, most of it isn\u2019t absorbed by tiny patches of soil, and the city is designed to not make puddles. As a result, thousands of gallons of water need to drain.

The water flows faster in the bathtub because it has less space to move around. Now, imagine that bathtub is a big city with lots of buildings, streets, and pavement. When it rains, the water flows faster in the city because it has less space to soak into the ground. This makes the water rise up and flood the streets. In a rural area, the water can soak into the ground more easily because there's more space for it to move around. This helps prevent flooding.

        "question": "ELI5: What is human flatulence?",
        "answer": "Not a gastroenterologist, but let's examine the premise and start with some facts in the hopes of getting some serious answers. I think the point of your question lies in fart-transmission being different from fecal transmission. We know well that we can get sick from bacteria/viruses going from poop to another persons mouth and infecting them that way. You're suggesting an airborne transmission of an intestinal illness (I think).  1. The average amount of gas a human produces in a day is roughly 1L (per Google) 2. The average amount of air exhaled in a day is roughly 11,000L.  So from this we know that if a microorganism had to choose spreading via farting which is to say by airborne transmission, that's 11,000 times *less efficient* than just going straight through the lungs. We also know that microorganisms generally infect/attack the place they are released from, so an intestinal infection prefers to attack the intestine which means it needs to be eaten, not inhaled. *It is possible* to get intestinal infections in your lungs and lung infections in your intestines in certain cases but this isn't common, it's not the preferred method of transmission.  We can also assume that most farts are filtered through underwear and pants, which is similar to wearing a face mask, it'll filter out many of the particulates that microorganisms ride on. So let's assume transmission from fart, through clothes, into the lungs is yet further unlikely.  In the end, this doesn't pass the sniff test (...ha), it's just too circuitous to be an intentional transmission route. Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that's really, really easy.  However, a quick google search gives an affirmative \"Not Completely Impossible\" as there are demonstrated cases of Cholera (an intestinal illness) infecting the lungs of people with immune disorders. In this case, it's most likely a case of dirty-surface fecal contamination being introduced to the lungs via touching the nose/mouth and *inhaling the feces* but still, it's credible.  So \"Not Fully Impossible\" but extremely unlikely unless you have extremely poor hygiene habits and are immunocompromised.",

Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that's really, really easy.  Thanks for taking the question seriously!  I guess what I've quoted above is one of the things I was curious about. The distinction between flatulence and feces. Can we draw a pretty stable line in the sand between the two, in most cases? Outside of some sort of serious sickness, where flatulence possibly leads to feces (sorry for gross visual), the two are basically in separate bacterial categories as far as I understand (please correct me if I'm wrong).  I know from reading random Reddit threads that many, many people like to sleep in their beds without any clothes. I've always found that idea sort of baffling for hygienic reasons, but then I started to wonder if my confusion/repulsion had any basis in fact. This is sort of the idiosyncratic origin story behind this thread's random question, I guess.  So I started to wonder...if those people are passing gas in bed while sleeping in the nude, are they rolling around in harmful bacteria? If they share their bed with someone else, or if someone else sleeps in that bed later on, would they also be rolling around in harmful bacteria? Would there be a risk of infection?

            " Here's a quick rundown:\nHuman flatulence is a natural bodily function where gas builds up in the digestive system and is released through the anus. The gas is made up of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane. It's a mix of swallowed air, food, and bacteria in the gut that break down undigested carbohydrates. The release of gas is usually odorless, but can be smelly if the gut bacteria produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like hydrogen sulfide, which has a strong, unpleasant smell. So, to summarize, human flatulence is just a normal part of digestion! \nNow, let's talk about the science behind human flatulence. While it's a natural process, there are some interesting facts about how it works:\n1.  The average person passes gas 14 times a day, releasing about 1-2 liters of gas.\n2.  The main culprits behind smelly flatulence are beans, cabbage, broccoli, and other high-fiber foods that contain raffinose, a complex sugar that's difficult for humans to digest.\n3.

            " Yes, it can. Our bodies have a built-in bypass system for muscle fatigue. It's called the \"recruitment of fast-twitch fibers.\" When your muscles get tired, your body shifts from slow-twitch fibers (which are good for endurance) to fast-twitch fibers (which are good for power). This allows you to push through fatigue and perform at a higher level for a short period of time. However, this comes at a cost: it's a temporary solution and can lead to injury if overused. So, while muscle fatigue can be bypassed, it's not a long-term solution and should be used judiciously. Can you explain how this works in more detail? Of course! Let's dive into the science behind muscle fatigue and the recruitment of fast-twitch fibers. Muscle fatigue is a complex process that involves multiple factors, including: 1. **Energy depletion**: When you exercise, your muscles use up their stored energy (ATP) and need to replenish it. If this process is impaired, muscle fatigue sets in. 2. **Acid buildup**: As you exercise, your muscles produce lactic acid, which can lead to fatigue. 3. **Neurological factors**: Your nervous system plays a crucial role in"

        "question": "ELI5: Can singularities be ever formed from an outsiders perspective?",
        "answer": "A quick note on terminology; the \"singularity\" is the theoretical point right in the centre of a massive object where its density and gravitational field are infinite under current best models. They may exist, or the models may be not quite right (e.g. quantum mechanics may get in the way). Black holes may have singularities at their centre. But black holes don't \"need\" singularities, they are defined by their event horizons.  The \"event horizon\" is the region around a black hole (technically a 2d surface) that makes a black hole special; it is the point where all worldlines (so future paths in spacetime - where things *could* go) of objects in that region end up falling down towards the massive object in the middle (see [this neat set of diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BH-no-escape-1.svg)). In the simple model for a black hole, the event horizon is a distance of 2GM/c^2 from the singularity (where G is the gravitational constant, M the total mass inside the event horizon and c the 'speed of light').  A black hole forms when there is enough mass within a small enough volume so that this distance (2GM/c^(2)) is outside the object. All that mass doesn't have to be concentrated at the singularity, it just has to be within the event horizon distance of it.  At the event horizon, from the perspective of an observer an infinite distance away, time dilation would be infinite. So when observing something fall into a black hole, you can never see the object cross the event horizon, it will just slow down and stop (and you can obviously never see it cross, as the light of it crossing can never reach you).  But locally everything looks normal. From the perspective of an object falling into the black hole, it doesn't notice the event horizon (although they'll be a lot of other stuff going on there - it won't be a friendly place to hang out), it just keeps falling. [This graphic shows this fairly well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gravitational_time_dilation_around_a_black_hole.gif) - on the left you have what things look like from the object's perspective as it falls in. On the right you have the outside observer's view. From the object's point of view, it just falls in as normal.  Of course, *this only applies once the black hole has formed*, so once the event horizon exists. Before then, the time dilation in that region, while significant, wouldn't be infinite. So there would still be time for things to fall in.  Disclaimer; I haven't done the maths (GR maths is notoriously difficult), but I suspect that yes, if you were an infinite distance away, it would take an infinite amount of time for a black hole to form. But if you are an infinite distance away none of that matters - you are too far away. If you are any closer (i.e. a finite distance away), it would take less than an infinite amount of time to form - and so it is possible.  And we know this is possible; black holes exist.",

All I'm asking about are singularities. Could they form?  &#x200B;  >Of course, *this only applies once the black hole has formed*, so once the event horizon exists. Before then, the time dilation in that region, while significant, wouldn't be infinite. So there would still be time for things to fall in.  So, you are saying, that when the star collapses the mass WILL, in a certainty, produce a singularity?   Let me show you my reasoning and correct me when I'm wrong (I assume I will be at some point): From a far away observer the black hole forms. Over a very long period it evaporates. In the end, it evaporates down to nothing. [According to this link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/05/20/ask-ethan-what-happens-when-a-black-holes-singularity-evaporates), the black hole cease to exist, the potential singularity is no more**.**    Now, from a perspective of a massive star: I begin to collapse. All the mass gravitates towards my center. Meanwhile, due to gravitational time dilation from GR, my time ticks slower relative to the rest of the universe. My size crosses the Schwarzschild radius, an Event Horizon is now present. However, now I start to loose mass due to Hawking Radiation. From an outsiders point of view, this is very slow, but from my point of view this is getting faster and faster. **Could the singularity form before Black Hole's mass is evaporated?**",

So you need to make sure that your income is very close to the money you spend in a given year.  The second trick is to only transfer wealth to income where the tax rates are most convenient to do so. When you have vastly more wealth than you need, you can \"plan\" when you take out certain amounts of money.  (e.g. long term investments are generally taxed lower than short term. So if you can \"plan\" to keep your money invested for years, you pay less tax when you sell them compared to buying and selling in the same year)  The third trick is to use shell companies to circumvent individual ownership. Wealth and income are taxed differently for companies than it is for individuals. aka jeff Bezos doesn't own a yacht. Jeff Bezos started a company, took out a loan at a bank (using his Amazon shares as collateral) and then the company buys the yacht. He then \"leases\" or \"rents\" the yacht from his own company.  This accomplishes a few things:  * He doesn't have to pay income taxes on the money used to buy the yacht. * He doesn't directly own the yacht, therefore it's not counted towards his net wealth. (and thus cannot be taxed) * The company has a whole bunch of tax write offs because it barely turns a profit.    * (in simple terms, the trick is to lease the yacht for just more than it costs the company to own/operate it)  \\*EDIT\\*  lease note that this is grossly simplified.

        "answer": "The same reason those other species have instincts. A coincidence of resources, circumstances, and/or sexual selection tendencies that shaped our evolution. i.e. Instincts helped some species survive.  Humans depend on their instincts less presumably because our other non-instinctive tendencies are more effective at causing successful reproduction and survival to reproductive age.  Neurologists argue that mutations in the human brain structure caused larger distances between the more primitive parts of our brain and memory storing areas. This distance that neural impulses need to travel still had to fit in a small skull which caused some cross-over signals to occur. Erroneous associations between things like recalling a memory of a tiger being dangerous and painful and that sharp rock you sat on to be similarly painful may constitute what we call \"creativity\" and enable ideas like using sharp rocks to defend from sharp tigers. This kind of association was not due to logical discourse but an accidental and irrational association of two mildly similar things due to neurons firing incorrectly. This erroneous processing that gave rise to creativity was selected for over and over due to its apparent value in creative problem solving.  So, it might be argued that creative problem solving has been a more effective means of survival, reproduction, and/or survival of young to reproductive age.

        "answer": "Major Central Banks (and the Exchequer) are pumping money into their economies through quantitative easing (QE). This is the Central Bank buying back government bonds from banks and therefore putting cash into the accounts of the banks. And this cash is not earning much when redeposited with the CB or when lent to other banks (near zero and sometimes negative rates).   Banks are therefore literally sitting on funds that they are not earning any money from if they cannot lend it to others. This explains their willingness to lend at very low rates. These loans (it is hoped) goes into productive investment and therefore helps push up economic activity through wage increases and consumption. Unfortunately, this cash also goes into asset purchases like property and the stock market which isn't exactly ideal (rising property prices and share prices leading to asset price \"bubbles\") Ultimately this kind of expansionary policy tends to lead to higher inflation which is what many people are fearing is happening now.   Until the Central Banks dial back this policy either by slowing down (tapering off) QE or by increasing interest rates, this might continue. The problem here is that while tapering and increasing interest dials down inflation pressure (the intended effect) it also risks a large fall in asset prices (housing and stock markets). The problem with rapidly falling asset prices is that this can lead to enormous pressure on banks to dial back quickly on loans (fearing loan defaults) and this becomes a multiplying effect on slowing down the economy (since a lot of economic activity relies on bank credit. This can lead to a condition called stagflation - where prices increase AND economic activity decreases, essentially the worst of both worlds.   Long story short, it is very possible that the Central Banks are willing to accept (hopefully temporary) higher inflation while trying to avoid massive and sudden asset price deflation.

It's like trying to explain a video game by referencing the pixels that make up the game, which are made up of even smaller pixels, and those are made up of even smaller pixels, and so on. Eventually, you're just referencing smaller and smaller versions of the same thing, and you never actually get to the explanation. Does that make sense? (Source: Reddit)\nThe concept of an infinite regress is a classic problem in philosophy, and it's great that you're thinking about it. Your analogy with the video game is a good one. To break it down further, an infinite regress occurs when you're trying to explain something by referencing something else, but that something else also needs an explanation, and so on. This creates a never-ending cycle of explanations, where each one relies on another, and another, and another.

So when that happens, a star is at the point of imminent collapse.  The Sun, specifically, does not make iron because its core is not hot and dense enough. The Sun is currently only hot enough to produce helium from hydrogen. Late in its life, the Sun will partially collapse until its core heats up enough to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen, but the Sun is not large enough to go any further than that.  > Also wouldn't stars make better nuclear reactors than our own nuclear reactors and particle accelerators?

            " The flavor of chewing gum is not just a topical thing, it\u2019s actually a process of releasing flavor molecules into the saliva in your mouth. The flavor molecules are initially trapped in tiny oil droplets in the gum. When you chew, the heat and friction from your teeth and tongue break down these oil droplets, releasing the flavor molecules into the saliva. However, the flavor molecules are also being carried away by the saliva and eventually get washed out of your mouth. This is why the flavor of chewing gum seems to last for only about 20 seconds. After that, the flavor molecules are no longer present in your mouth, and the flavor disappears. The flavor is not just a topical thing, but rather a temporary release of flavor molecules into the saliva. This process is also why some gum flavors can be more intense or longer-lasting than others. The intensity and duration of the flavor are determined by the size and composition of the oil droplets, as well as the rate at which they are broken down by the saliva. So, the next time you chew gum, remember that the flavor you\u2019re experiencing is not just a surface sensation, but a complex process involving the release of flavor molecules into the saliva.

        "follow-up": ">how do those electrical signals convert back to a sound  Magnets. Seriously, it's just magnets.  When your voice hits the microphone on your phone, it vibrates a magnet back and forth, and the vibrating magnet ripples the electrons in the phone line.  When the ripples (which travel almost at the speed of light) reach the person on the other end, they go into another magnet. When a magnet connected to wires is vibrated, it ripples the electrons \u2014 and when the rippling electrons touch the magnet on the other side, it vibrates the magnet! It's literally the inverse of how it went in. Yeah, that's right, a speaker is fundamentally *the same exact thing* as a microphone, just built differently to better suit the task.  So, when the magnet in the speaker on your friend's phone vibrates, it moves the air around it, because all moving objects contain momentum that transfers to the molecules around it. And these air movements are sound \u2014 your voice, to be exact.  >that mimics a persons pitch or tone of voice so precisely?  Now, to address this part. If you move the magnet back and forth very quickly at 256 Hz (256 back-and-forths per second) the person on the other end hears a pure C note. Just one note.  Your voice is a complex superposition of a shitton of different pure fundamental frequencies. In other words, your voice is multiple pure notes played at the same time. When you say \"hey dude,\" your vocal cords are producing many individual pure notes that add up to form a much more complex sound. *All* sounds can be broken up into constituent pure notes. This is the concept of the Fourier transform, but you don't need to worry about that.  How do all those notes fit into the phone line at the same time? Well, they just sorta... do. Electrons are *tiny.* Go look up the size of an electron \u2014 yeah, they're really freaking small. Tons of them can fit on a very small wire at the same time. So, each of the sound waves that add up to your voice are simply carried along the wire simultaneously. Imagine if cars were like ghosts, and they could just pass through each other while driving to their destination. That's what electrons are like.

            "\u00a0\nVoice calls across the world are instant because of a network of satellites and fiber-optic cables that transmit signals in a matter of milliseconds. When you make a call, your voice is converted into digital signals, which are then sent through these networks. The signals don't travel through space like a physical object, but rather as a series of 1s and 0s that are transmitted electronically. This process is called packet switching, where the digital signals are broken into small packets and transmitted through multiple routes to reach their destination. The packets are then reassembled at the receiving end, allowing for near-instant communication.\u00a0\nThe speed of sound is approximately 343 meters per second, while the speed of light is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. The signals in voice calls don't actually \"travel\" at the speed of light, but rather are transmitted through the network in a matter of milliseconds, which is incredibly fast compared to the speed of sound.

Rather, one of the chromosomes that we all have a pair of gets an extra copy, so the embryo has three instead of the regular two.   For most chromosomes, if you have three instead of two, it doesn't lead to viable embryo. The child will die either in the uterus, or at a young age. For some chromosomes, the \"damage\" is less severe, and the child will survive, but may have health problems, including often a reduced life expectancy. Down syndrome, for instance, is caused by a *trisomy* (three chromosome copies) of the 21st chromosome (we all have 23 chromosome pairs that scientists have labeled with numbers 1-23).  Down syndrome is always caused by trisomy of the 21st chromosome, but there are other trisomies that are compatible with life and lead to different symptoms, such as trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). The latter is more severe and often results in miscarriage too, but some fetuses do survive.   For sex chromosomes, i.e. X and Y, typical females have a pair, XX, while typical males have two different copies, XY. You can have trisomy of these sex chromosomes too, leading to combinations like XXX, XXY or XYY.

However, I can explain how a hypothetical 24th chromosome might work, if it existed. In humans, each cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. A 24th chromosome would be a new pair of chromosomes that would add to the total number of chromosomes. If a 24th chromosome existed, it would likely have a similar structure to the other chromosomes, with genes on it that would provide instructions for the development and function of the organism. The 24th chromosome would have to be compatible with the other chromosomes in order to work properly, and it would need to be integrated into the cell's genetic machinery in a way that allows it to be expressed and regulated appropriately. In other words, a 24th chromosome would need to be able to communicate with the other 23 pairs of chromosomes and work together with them to produce the correct proteins and other molecules that the cell needs to function properly.

It works by disrupting the cell's membrane and interfering with the cell's ability to function properly. This can cause cells to die, leading to damage to tissues and organs. In humans, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to a range of health problems, including liver damage, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. In terms of its ability to kill bacteria and other microorganisms, alcohol is often used as a disinfectant in medical and industrial settings. However, it's worth noting that not all bacteria are killed by alcohol, and some types of bacteria can even develop resistance to its effects. So, while alcohol is a potent poison, it's not a cure-all for killing germs.\nHere are some key points to consider:\nAlcohol is a toxic substance that can harm or kill cells.\nIt disrupts cell membranes and interferes with cell function.\nExcessive alcohol consumption can lead to health problems in humans.\nAlcohol can be used as a disinfectant, but it's not effective against all bacteria.\nSome bacteria can develop resistance to alcohol's effects.

On top of that, the alcohol can also cause proteins to warp in ways that either render them useless or even harmful to the cell.  When it comes to disinfectants, you will likely often see 70% alcohol being used. This is actually for a number of reasons. On an economic level, it's simply cheaper and easier to make.

This is because people with good credit often get better financing options, which means they can buy newer, more expensive cars. The dealerships then sell the cars they can't sell to people with bad credit at a higher price, making up for the difference. This is called \"marking up\" the price of the car. It's a way for dealerships to make a profit, even when they can't sell their cars to people with good credit.

Here\u2019s how:\n1. **Frequency matching**: The two grids need to operate at the same frequency (e.g., 50 or 60 Hz). This is like setting the tempo for the orchestra.\n2. **Phase angle matching**: The phase angles of the two grids need to be aligned, like the musicians playing the same note at the same time.\n3. **Power flow control**: The grids need to be able to exchange power smoothly, like the musicians playing in harmony.\nTo achieve this, power grid operators use specialized equipment, such as **phasor measurement units** and **power flow controllers**, to monitor and adjust the frequency and phase angle of the grids in real-time.

When an object moves at high speed, the air around it heats up, creating a layer of hot gas that can ignite if it's in contact with a flammable material. This can happen with objects like rockets, bullets, or even a car's tires. The friction generated by high-speed movement creates heat, which can lead to a fire.\nThe key concept here is friction-induced ignition, where the heat generated by friction between the object and the air causes a fire. This can occur when an object moves at extremely high speeds, creating a hot gas layer around it that can ignite a flammable material. In summary, moving too fast can generate enough heat through friction to start a fire. This is a rare occurrence, but it's a real phenomenon that can happen in certain situations. 1. Friction: When an object moves quickly, it generates friction with the air around it. This friction creates heat. 2. Heat buildup: The heat generated by friction builds up around the object. 3.

Now the other problem is that there is really no good reason to want to do this in the first place.

If you run a direct wire between the live and ground prongs of your outlet, there is little to impede their flow and you get a flood of electrons - breakers in your house shut off power when this happens.  Devices limit their current draw in different ways. Basic resistive components have a resistance - they are highly imperfect conductors and so electrons encounter a lot of resistance as they try to move. This hinders the flow. One of the most basic equations you'll find in electronics is V=IR, which describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.  Other devices may use inductive or capacitive limits - AC power is constantly trying to change, and these components can limit it by either requiring or resisting change - unlike a resistor these do not turn energy into heat and so are more efficient.  More modern supplies switch on and off. By switching on and off faster or slower, we can limit how much power flows through without bulky capacitors or inductors and without the waste of resistors.

The tl;dr is not to worry about it if you're not a mathematician.  Basically angular displacement is a rotation. And rotations don't commute. Which means they can't be vectors because mathematicians have said that one of the rules for vectors is that they have to commute under addition. So you can't use vectors, you have to use matrices.  Could we define vectors in a different way? Sure. But mathematicians have gone with that.  There are a few things like this where things that we treat as vectors or think of as vectors (outside mathematics) don't fit the strict definitions of vectors, but provided we don't tell the mathematicians it is all fine. Angular velocity and magnetic fields, for example, don't strictly meet the mathematical definition of a vector, but they are close enough that no one else cares - in these examples the things don't transform the 'right' way under reflections or similar transformations. Rotations are even worse at pretending to be a vector than these things, so the difference is a bigger deal.  The infinitesimal angular displacement is \"allowed\" to be a vector(ish) because it does commute up to second order terms. So if it is small enough the difference isn't noticeable.",

That's the engine.   So the engine is actually the majority of the code in the \"game\". It's not surprising it affects almost everything.   Yes, every engine has its upper limits. Something like the original Doom, for example, was designed to run on a DOS computer in 1994 or whatever, and it takes a lot of shortcuts for speed, and has a lot of limitations to make those shortcuts work. You can't look up or down in the original Doom. And the monsters aren't even 3D. Those are the limitations people accepted in exchange for getting it to work at all.  Sometimes there are fundamental design tradeoffs. For example, Factorio has a multiplayer mode. There's a lot of stuff happening in a Factorio game and it would be laggy if the server had to keep telling every player what was happening around them. So what it actually does is each player's computer runs the entire game and they stay synced up. But this means you can't have anything in the game that's random, because they'd get out of sync. Even things that seem random aren't actually random. It also means every player's computer needs to download a copy of the entire game world, when they log in. And it means if anyone's computer is too slow to run the game at normal speed, everyone gets slowed down, or that person gets kicked out.  So you can either have multiplayer that isn't laggy, **or** people with slow computers can play multiplayer, but not both. And changing from one to the other means rewriting the whole multiplayer part of the game from scratch. If you show someone a game that's designed to avoid the lag and ask how slow computers can play multiplayer without slowing everything down, the answer is they can't. It's not that it's impossible; it's just impossible *in that engine design with the fast multiplayer*. If you changed it it wouldn't be the same multiplayer engine any more. Hope this helps.",

            " A videogame engine is like a construction blueprint for a building. It provides a framework and tools for creating the building (the game). The quality of the graphics is heavily influenced by the engine's capabilities, just like how the quality of a building's design is influenced by the blueprint. A more advanced engine can handle more complex graphics and physics, making the game look better and more realistic. Think of it like comparing a LEGO set to a CAD design software. The LEGO set (older engine) has limited pieces and complexity, while the CAD software (newer engine) has a vast library of parts and advanced tools to create intricate designs. The CAD software can produce a more detailed and realistic model, just like a more advanced videogame engine can produce more detailed and realistic graphics. So, the engine's quality affects the quality of the graphics, making it a crucial aspect of game development. \nThis answer is written in a style that is easy to understand, even for someone who is not familiar with videogame engines.

Now most matrices aren't that simple and they will do a combination of operations, changing the length and direction of vectors in complex ways.For a given matrix an eigenvector is one which doesn't have its direction changed, i.e only its length is scaled when you multiply it by that matrix. The eigenvalue is how much that length is scaled.  For example if we have some matrix M and a vector (3,5). Then say we multiply M\\*V and get a new vector (6,10) which = 2\\*(3,5).

        "answer": "You must have at least two sources of audio for stereo to work. It is essentially divided into a left and right source relative to the listener. By varying the levels on the two sides independently, you can create the effect of a sound moving from left to right in your heard.  The most basic of this would be a constant noise, panning back and forth from one side to the other. At the middle point, L and R will be playing the sound with the same amplitude. When the noise is panned in your left ear, the L will ramp up amplitude while the R will decrease in amplitude, and vice versa.  There are more complicated techniques too but this is a basic explanation.",

            "\u00a0\nAnswer: It's because of something called \"audio panning\" and \"stereo imaging.\" When a sound is mixed, the left and right speakers or headphones play different frequencies or volumes to create the illusion of a sound coming from different directions. For example, if a voice is on the left, the left speaker will play the voice louder and the right speaker will play the voice quieter. This makes your brain think the sound is coming from the left. It's like a magic trick!\u00a0\nBut, what if you only have one speaker or earbud? How do they make it seem like the sound is all around you then? That's where \"binaural recording\" comes in. It's a special way of recording audio that takes into account how our brains process sound from different directions. The recording is made with microphones placed in the same way that our ears are, and it creates a 3D effect when played back through headphones. It's like your brain is tricked into thinking the sound is coming from all around you!\u00a0\nSo, to sum it up, audio panning and stereo imaging make sound seem like it's coming from different directions, and binaural recording creates a 3D effect that makes it seem like sound is all around"

        "answer": "It is not unusual for vaccines to require multiple stabs for full efficiency. After the first injection you get a strong response from the immune system that will be able to get rid of the vaccine. But you only get a partial respons from the memory cells that is responsible for helping the immune system recognizing future infections. So another injection as the first immune response have died down can help increase the number of memory cells. As for why there is exactly 3 weeks between the stabs for the BioNTech vaccine is because that was what they used in their stage 3 trial so that is what have been certified. Most of the vaccines we administer have had a lot of testing to figure out how they are most efficient while they wait for the paperwork to complete. But for vaccines like the coronavirus vaccines as well as the seasonal flu we do not have time for this so we just make educated guesses and run trials to make sure this is safe and effective.  There are lots of indications suggesting that the BioNTech vaccine works just fine with just one shot. The trial can be interpreted as low as 65% efficiency after three weeks but some suggest this might be as high as 98% after five weeks with just one stab. And some countries are delaying the second injection in order to make sure as many people as possible have the first injection as soon as possible.",

But time is a tricky thing, because it is and isn't. It is a thing that exists between things that exist. If you have an empty cube with absolutely nothing in it, no particles no interacting forces, there is no time in it. Time exists between two things that interact.   For an observer to say that something has happened, it can only measure it from it's perspective so time comes in to existence from our perspective. If it can't interact with us or we can't observe it, the time starts existing in practical sense. Yes it can exist between other things, but only thing that matters is the observer and the other thing. Even if there isn't a direct link to observe or for interaction, there can be indirect thing, in which case time comes in to existence through the chain that leads all to way to the even itself.   I don't know if it makes it any easier, but stuff like this becomes way easier to understand when you accept the fact that time is not a thing, while also being a thing. Time is a thing between things, it can not exist by itself.

It took months and months, and it was *hard*.   True in my case it was a \"simple\" matter of \"calories in, calories out\" but like ... who the hell can just live like that? I could not make that my life forever. There's no way. I had a baby in 2020 and am trying for a second now, and when that's over I'll restrict calories again to keep myself around 5'8\" and 160, but like ... no way will I be doing 1,052 calories every day.

While medical science has made significant progress in understanding these systems, developing a quick fix has proven challenging. Exercise and dieting work by influencing these systems, but they require a sustained effort and can have varying effects on different individuals. In contrast, a \"quick fix\" would need to precisely target the underlying biology, which is still not fully understood.

            " \nA: The answer is quite simple. Companies are primarily motivated by profit, and stagnating wages allows them to maximize profits in the short term. Retaining employees with raises is a long-term investment, and companies often prioritize short-term gains over long-term benefits. This is an example of the \"short-termism\" phenomenon, where companies prioritize short-term profits over long-term sustainability. \nB: Companies are often controlled by shareholders who prioritize profit over people, leading to stagnating wages and turnover costs. This is because shareholders are incentivized to maximize short-term profits, which can lead to decisions that harm employees and the company in the long run. \nC: The answer is that companies often prioritize the interests of executives and shareholders over those of employees. This can lead to stagnating wages and turnover costs, as companies may be more willing to invest in executive bonuses and stock buybacks than in employee raises. \nD: Companies are often motivated by a desire to maintain power and control over their workforce, which can lead to stagnating wages and turnover costs.

        "answer": "The comments are mostly right, but I wanted to try to simplify it even more. The question is, what is heat? The easiest way to think about heat is if we're talking about a gas made up of a bunch of atoms. Temperature in this system is a measure of how much those atoms jiggle. If they're jiggling a lot, then they're very hot. If they're not jiggling much, then it's cold. If you touch a hot gas, the atoms in the gas hit your hand very quickly and cause the atoms in your hand to jiggle from all the impacts. If you light a match, the energy from the match causes the atoms to jiggle even more meaning it's heating up more. If you throw a ball in the gas, every atom it hits gains energy, and then hits a bunch of other atoms causing the entire gas to gain jiggling while slowing down the ball (air friction).  Now how do you remove the jiggling from the gas? There is a concept in physics called entropy. Smashing an egg on the ground is very easy to do. Putting the egg back together again takes a lot of time and effort. Similarly, getting a billion gas molecules to jiggle is easy. Getting them all to stop jiggling is very hard and takes effort.

        "answer": "We can have just carbohydrates to burn for energy, and in a healthy body, carbohydrates are burned first. Brain and other nerve cells can only process glucose; if you don\u2019t ingest it; your liver has to break down muscle tissues to extract glycogen and supply glucose to the brain.   Fats are both used as energy store and as building blocks; most cell membranes are based on triglycerides and many metabolic processes require fats as solvents for other things.   Protein does not need to be burned for energy; proteins are used as energy source only if there are no others; among other things because cells can\u2019t process them as easily as carbohydrate, because there\u2019s some nasty nitrogen residue left overs etc. Normally proteins get broken down in amino acids and cellular mechanisms use these to repair and build cells, build enzymes, build transport molecules for key chemical reactions etc.",

The energy from the protein is released as you build and repair those tissues, but it's not a direct \"burning\" of protein for energy like it is with carbohydrates or fats. Think of it more like a building block, where the protein is used to construct new tissues, and the energy is released as a byproduct.

These metals are good at reflecting light too, but they also have a special property called \"conductivity\". This means they can carry electricity really well. In a mirror, the silver coating is thin and doesn't conduct electricity as much as a thick piece of metal would. This makes it perfect for reflecting light, but not conducting electricity. So, even though white surfaces reflect a lot of light, silver is a better choice for mirrors because of its conductivity and ability to reflect light well.  2023-03-07\nI was trying to explain why mirrors are silver, but I got sidetracked by the conductivity part. The main reason mirrors are silver is because silver is a great reflector of light. It has a high reflectivity, which means it can reflect about 95-98% of the light that hits it. This is much higher than most other materials, including white surfaces.

        "question": "ELI5: If lightning takes the shortest path to the ground, why is it all jagged-like in the sky, and not a straight line?",
        "answer": "How a lightning bolt (or any electric arc) forms:  1. Two opposite charge distributions build up in the clouds and ground, creating a voltage between the two and therefor an electric field distributed in the space between them.  2. In some area, usually near a sharp point in one of the charge distributions, the electric field exceeds the breakdown strength of air, stripping electrons from the air molecules and causing that area to become conductive.  3. Charge from the charge distribution flows into this area until it is at the same voltage. That small patch of volume is now a conductive extension of the charge distribution.  4. There is now the same voltage between the two charge distributions, and at a slightly smaller distance, further concentrating the electric field between the two, which will lead to further breakdown of the air.  5. This process repeats continuously until a full conductive path of ionized air is created between the charge distributions. At which point the entirety of the charge will flow and the two opposite charge distributions will neutralize each other. As the charge is depleted, the electric field will weaken, and no new paths will be formed, first path to ground wins.  So why is the path jagged?  If you took two metal plates, one at 0v and one at 12v, there would be an electric field evenly distributed between them. Now if you took a third plate at 0v and put it between the other two, the electric field would be concentrated between the middle plate and the 12v plate, the presence of the middle plate has deprived the outer 0v plate of its surrounding electric field.  It works similarly in lightning, streamers lower to the ground will block the progress of streamers above, streamers to the sides of other streamers will tend to redirect them away. Each one at any instant will progress in the direction of the strongest electric field, and they will influence each other\u2019s electric fields to point away from each other.  The geometry of the charge distributions and the shape of the streamers at any instant during the process will ultimately determine the path of lightning.  The \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d explanation is not true and this isn\u2019t even rigorously well defined when you think about it. The charge distributions will build up along the surfaces facing each other, you could pick two points on these surfaces and find the path between them which has the smallest line integral of resistivity along it. But which two points? The answer will be different for different points. And the resistivity of the various sections of air is dynamically changing as the conductive path is being formed, so the path of least resistance is constantly changing too. Not to mention the resistivity of air should only be dependent on its temperature, pressure and humidity which will not vary so much for neighboring patches of air, so you wouldn\u2019t expect such a jagged path if it was truly resistance driving the process. It would be a straight line or have a slight but smooth curve to account for the changing pressure, temperature and humidity as a function of altitude.  So it\u2019s not the path of least resistance, it\u2019s a complex result of the instantaneous geometry of the charge distributions and current locations of the other streamers which will guide a streamer in one direction or the other. I don\u2019t think there is a simple way to characterize the path which lightning will ultimately take in any given situation.",

        "answer": "The taste that we associate with metal is actually your brain's generic error response to nonsensical taste information coming from your mouth.  Anything that causes the neurons in your taste buds to begin firing off randomly will produce a metal taste.  The reason that we associate the taste with metal is because the most common way to cause temporary dysfunction in your taste buds is by putting something made out of metal in your mouth.  Metal itself has no taste.  When you put a metal object in your mouth you're creating an environment that is very similar to a weak battery.  This creates a very slight electrical current within your mouth, triggering the neurons in your taste buds to malfunction.  Your brain doesn't doesn't know how to process that information and you end up tasting \"error\".    The reason that we associate the taste of \"error\" with that of metal is because sticking something metal in your mouth is a pretty common occurrence for most kids - so its pretty likely that the first time you taste \"error\" will be the result of putting metal in your mouth.  There isn't a whole lot other than metal that will produce an error taste, so because the only experience most people will have had with the taste is sticking a metal object in their mouth, they associate the taste with metal.  One of the few other things that will cause the taste buds in your mouth to malfunction is high levels of radiation.  That radiation both  directly damages the taste buds and has an interaction with your saliva that creates a slight electrical current in your mouth.  The end result is that your taste buds begin firing off randomly and generate the \"error\" taste that people typically associate with metal.",

        "answer": "Sound is what happens when the particles in a material push against each other in a wave. Honestly, it\u2019s very similar to just waves you would see in the ocean. Particles bunch up into a wave, and then spread out between the waves.   Light on the other hand, is what happens when the electromagnetic field oscillates.   To explain that a bit more, imagine a magnet. When you hold the magnet near a piece of iron, the iron will get pulled towards the magnet. The strength of the pull depends on how far away the magnet is though. If the magnet is basically touching the iron, it gets pulled really hard, but if the magnet is on the other side of the room, it hardly pulls the iron at all.   That \u201cpull\u201d is analogous to the magnetic field. When the iron is being pulled strongly, the magnetic field put out by the magnet is strong at the iron\u2019s location. When the iron is hardly being pulled, the magnetic field is pretty weak. As a disclaimer, this isn\u2019t a completely accurate way to picture the magnetic field, since it also has a direction, but it\u2019s close enough.   Now, that \u201cpull\u201d doesn\u2019t have to travel through any matter. It\u2019s not like the magnet is sending a pulse through the air telling the iron to come towards it. The magnetic field fills up all of \u201cempty\u201d space, so a magnet could pull iron even in empty space, without any air.   Now, another thing to understand is that the magnetic field, what we were just talking about, and the electric field, which makes charged particles attract/repel each other, are connected. The important bit here is that when a magnetic field changes, it causes the electric field nearby to change as well.   That means that if you cause a change in the magnetic field, say by moving a magnet away, that change will cause a pulse in the electric field.   Where it gets weird is that changes in the electric field do the same thing. When you change the electric field, it will cause a magnetic field to appear.   So, let\u2019s say you move a magnet away quickly. That will cause the magnetic field in the area to drop off suddenly. That change in the magnetic field will make a pulse in the electric field just ahead of it. But now, if the electric field just pulsed, that means it changed, and a changing electric field causes a magnetic field.

        "answer": "\\[EDIT: Oh wow! My first silver! Thank you, you glorious human! OMG! Two silvers! You people are simply majestic!\\]  I work as a Library Tech at a large metropolitan library. My dept does the purchasing and assignment to branches of purchased items - books, ebooks, audiobooks, CDs, DVDs, you name it.  The short answer is that publishers don't sell the electronic items to libraries, they license them with certain conditions; To offer 6 copies for circulation we have to buy 6 licenses, usually at a rate much higher than you could buy it through Amazon. Each of these licenses are single-use, meaning only one check-out at a time is allowed.  But wait! There's more!  Part of the purchase license is a limit to how many times that one licensed ebook can be circulated - and that's often a rather small number. So those 6 copies/licenses, maybe each can only circ 10 times, so really we only get 60 circs out of it. If the ebook is popular and the item keeps getting reserves on it, then we have to keep buying licenses.  Now our regular paper books, which we buy at a price just higher than retail (often reinforced bindings) can circ 20 or more times before they fall apart, so the license model means we pay significantly more per circ.  For us, as a library, and ebook, audiobook, or any other electronic item ISN'T any different that a paper book. We catalog and track them in exactly the same way. Not because it's easier or anything, but because book/item circulation is the most important metric we use in both funding and budget planning. When you do several million circs per year it's nescessary info.

        "question": "ELI5: Can somebody explain to me bullet calibers?",
        "answer": "The other two comments nailed the whole metric versus imperial thing, but its actually a fair bit more complex than that. Never fear, I'm your friendly neighborhood gun guy.  \"50 cal\" is a term that most people attribute to .50 BMG, but .50 BMG is definitely not the only .50 caliber cartridge. The reason that most calibers have either a military designation (5.56x45mm, 7.62x39mm) or a word after the caliber designation is because no two calibers are exactly the same.  In the case of x.xx*xx mm, those are military designations, usually NATO. They denote the diameter of the bullet, and the length of the brass case. But for more Imperial calibers, you'll see \".30-06 Springfield,\" \".270 Winchester,\" \".223 Remington,\" \"9mm Parabellum,\" \".45 ACP,\" etc.  The diameter of the bullet is a small part of the equation. For example, there is 9x19mm, aka 9mm Parabellum, or just 9mm. But there are tons of calibers with a 9mm diameter bullet. .380 Auto, .357 Magnum, 9x18 Makarov, 9x39 Soviet, etc. The differences come from case length and design, and powder load. More powder with the same bullet means more force on target.  You would be correct in saying, \".45 ACP is a bigger bullet than 5.56.\" But 45 ACP is designed for handguns, and as such has a shorter case and smaller powder load. This helps keep the guns, well, handguns, and helps with controllability under recoil.  There are probably thousands of \"30 cal\" calibers in this world, and they do not all perform the same, and most likely won't fit and fire safely in guns not specifically marked for them.  .50 BMG is probably the largest caliber that you can own without filling out paperwork for a Destructive Device from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Because somebody decided at some point that any firearm with a bore larger than half an inch was essentially a cannon.  When looking at terminal ballistics (how good is this bullet at breaking that thing), you have to take into consideration bullet size, bullet weight, and powder load at a minimum. 9mm has a smaller powder load than 45 ACP, and pushes a smaller bullet (about half the weight) about 30% faster. 5.56 on the other hand, is basically pushing a .22 at 2800-3100 feet per second, around 3x as fast as the 9mm.  What could help you greatly in your understanding is to go on the interwebs and find a picture of a few calibers side by side.

Obviously you can't ACTUALLY fold a sheet of paper 42 times, but if you could, here's how it would work:  if 500 sheets of paper are about 2\" as you say, 1 sheet would be 0.004 inches.  1 fold would make 0.008 inches (0.004 * 2^1)  2 folds would make 0.016 inches (0.004 * 2^2)  so 42 folds is 0.004 * 2^42 = 17592186044.4 inches = 277,654.45 miles.

        "answer": "In engineering risk assessment there is a theory called the cheese model. Imagine many slices of cheese, each with some holes in random positions. Each slice of cheese represents one entity in the engineering project, and holes represent safety holes in that one entity. A risk factor (hole) in one entity can be blocked by another entity. However, sometimes you're unlucky and all the holes align. Everything is at the wrong place at the same time, and disaster happens.   Truth is, humans *will* make mistakes. It is unavoidable. Any attempts to reduce risk *will* cause risks of its own. The best we can do is to have many layers of cheese (safety mechanism) so that the chance of holes aligning (all safety mechanisms failing) is as small as possible. The desire to blame a single entity for disasters is not only wrong, but also makes the entire system prone to future disasters. If we only blame one slice of cheese for the entire disaster, problems in every other slice of cheese is not fixed, or even worse, those holes get larger due to complacency.",
