    "question": "ELI5: Why do words stop sounding like words when thought about too much?",
    "answer": "When you say or think of a word (for example, \u201cpink\u201d), it creates a sensation in your brain. That sensation is electric impulses traveling from neuron to neuron in a specific, complex network that your brain accepts and registers as \u201cpink\u201d. However, during the travel of the electric impulse, your neurons release certain chemicals, and those chemicals need to be restored. This is known as \u201creuptake.\u201d  Thus, when you first think \u201cpink,\u201d all the neurons used to create that thought are all strong and ready to give you a nice, strong, comprehensive, and clear idea of pink. However, after immediately triggering those neurons over and over and over, while your neurons are still in the reuptake process, they get, \u201ctired out\u201d in a way, and aren\u2019t all able to perform as expected.   Duly note; neurons firing is like a gun firing; they either do or don\u2019t. They can\u2019t half fire and create a weak image. Instead, the idea of pink gets less and less clear as less and less neurons are working to create the image until they all \u201cpass out\u201d and you\u2019re left thinking \u201c...what IS pink?\u201d",

Think of the way even modern things get hidden over relatively short periods.

That would result in quadruple the distance between two components - and while electrons do travel with very high speeds (not quite light speed, but close, relatively speaking) with the amount of electrons being moved you'd have a much slower CPU in the end.  That's why the actual transistors are getting smaller and smaller - so you can pack them more densely and reduce the distance between them, to make faster CPUs.",
    "follow-up": "You\u2019re kinda right, but actually almost entirely wrong about the underlying physics and your conclusion about distance unfortunately. I don\u2019t say this to be mean; you were simply lied to in school, Cuz they teach it that way to make it easier for kids to understand the basics.   It\u2019s not so much the distance/ resistance of the silicon or wires that matters;   it\u2019s more about how the gate size of smaller transistors uses a smaller current, and therefore uses less energy. So if you can get smaller and smaller transistors onto the same amount of silicon, you have more transistors to do operations with and each trans. Uses less electrical energy. Lower current with the same voltage is overal less electrical work, and is therefore also less heat created/dissipated. The distance between transistors is almost irrelevant In terms of electrical energy and heat.   >\tand while electrons do travel with very high speeds (not quite light speed, but close, relatively speaking) with the amount of electrons being moved you'd have a much slower CPU in the end.  This statement is actually completely wrong; not to be mean, this is exactly the conclusion a reasonable person makes when you\u2019re taught about electricity in grade school. But it\u2019s wrong.   To be nit picky; electrons do not move at the speed of light ( or close to it) in a wire. I\u2019m fact they don\u2019t really do that outside of a wire either unless under very particular and somewhat rare circumstances. It takes a lot of energy to accelerate an electron to near speed of light speeds; that\u2019s one reason why the large hadron collider is so huge.   Electrons actually move pretty slow. What\u2019s actually happening is all the electrons in the wire are bumping into each other; like a long conga line playing telephone.   \u201c[The Speed of Electrons in Copper](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2916283&seqNum=4):   How fast do signals travel down a transmission line? **If it is often erroneously believed that the speed of a signal down a transmission line depends on the speed of the electrons in the wire**. With this false intuition, we might imagine that reducing the resistance of the interconnect will increase the speed of a signal. In fact, **the speed of the electrons in a typical copper wire is actually about 10 billion times slower than the speed of the signal**.\u201d  \u201cWith this simple analysis, *we see that the speed of an electron in a wire is incredibly slow compared to the speed of light in air*. **The speed of an electron in a wire really has virtually nothing to do with the speed of a signal**. Likewise, as we will see, the resistance of the wire has only a very small, almost irrelevant effect on the speed of a signal in a transmission line. It is only in extreme cases that the resistance of an interconnect affects the signal speed\u2014and even then the effect is only very slight. We must recalibrate our intuition from the erroneous notion that lower resistance will mean faster signals.  But how do we reconcile the speed of a signal with the incredibly slow speed of the electrons in a wire? How does the signal get from one end of the wire to the other in a much shorter amount of time than it takes an electron to get from one end to the other? **The answer lies in the interactions between the electrons**.\u201d  And to be even more not picky; the actual electrons themselves nor their electrical potential energy are not what is supplying electrical energy to the circuit; it is actually the electric field created by the battery/wiring connecting the components in a circuit.   The full explanation however involves the Poynting vector, and some base college level calculus so I\u2019ll just leave the explanation in this video that does a great job explaining this concept without challenging math.

    "answer": "If you're only interested in *air quality...* Sure, humans could potentially survive in 5,000ppm CO2, but there would be pretty profound physiological and cognitive impacts to that long-term.  Around 1,000ppm is where harms to health begin, and exposure to 30,000 and above is generally only allowed for short intervals.  In EL5: Carbon dioxide builds up in blood as a byproduct of your body and cells working.  This \"waste\" from your cells actually turns your blood acidic and the gas needs to be removed before it begins to damage fragile organs, which is done in your lungs every time your breathe. Your lungs *really* like to exchange CO2 between your blood and the air, which is usually a good thing when you have a lot of carbon dioxide in your blood and little in the air. However, as the air you inhale becomes more saturated with CO2, your lungs will actually work \"backwards\" to move carbon dioxide from the *air into your blood.* This likely comes down to the fact that human lungs have evolved to expect atmospheric CO2 at <500ppm concentrations, so its never been an evolutionary advantage to figure out how to do that.   Plants, by contrast, use atmospheric carbon as a sort of \"fuel\" during photosynthesis - not producing it as waste - so have no such issue with a buildup of concentration.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is a recurrence relation in context of algorithms ?",
    "answer": "A recurrence relation is fundamentally a mathematical concept, so you're not going to fully understand it until you put some time in to think about the math. But here's an example of applying one.   Suppose you're cutting a piece of paper. Each time you cut the paper, you take all the pieces and stack them on top of each other, then cut right down the middle.   Now we want a function for the number of pieces of paper produced by c cuts. Intuitively, we know we'll go from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16... pieces of paper. We can therefore jump right to an analytic function: f(c) =2\\^(c-1). However, we can also write the recurrence relation. Each time we cut we double the number of pieces of paper we had before: r(c) = 2\\*r(c-1) for c>0. We also need to specify that we started with 1 piece of paper: r(0)=1.   Both ways of expressing the number of pieces of paper are valid and useful. For my money, the recurrence relation better expresses our intuition. Each cut produces twice as many pieces as the number we had before that cut. A computer is also very good at calculating the recurrence relation because it just means writing a simple function and calling it a bunch of times. This is not to say that a computer should have any trouble with 2\\^(c-1), but there are plenty of recursive expressions that don't have an analytical equivalent (like the Fibonacci sequence), yet they're still easy for computers. This is one reason why recurrence relations are such a big part of algorithms.",
    "follow-up": "Not OP, but thanks for the explanation. I'm just a little lost here, f(c)=2^(c-1)  That would mean that for 3 cuts (\"c\"), f(c)=2^(3-1), which would be f(c)=2^2, correct? Hence, f(c)=4. Shouldn't the answer be 8 though?",

If you have 3 satellites overhead in space and they all were broadcasting a time synchronized signal, you could triangulate your position very accurately. Like within a few meters. Very handy for flying planes and dropping bombs very accurately.   So they launched a bunch of satellites up there and everything was great. At the time only the military could access / decode the signals. Then, a Korean airliner (which did NOT have GPS obviously) flew into Russian airspace and the Russians shot it down (they weren't very friendly back then and it didn't help that the Korean pilots couldn't communicate very well) thinking it was an American spy plane which they were expecting at the time. Anyways, lots of people died.   Realizing that that really sucked, and GPS totally could have prevented that from happening, President Reagan decided that everyone should have access to GPS signals.

My grandparents weren\u2019t eating out all the time, sucking down 5+ dollar coffees daily, energy drinks, paying for expensive cell phones and data plans with another internet bill at home. They didn\u2019t spend hours a day shopping on Amazon or having door dash bring dinner that doubles the price, they weren\u2019t paying for childcare and Netflix or cable even. They had a very basic set of bills every month and because of that they were able to pay cash for their land then keep saving till they could afford to build their house with out borrowed money, that saves all that interest that we pay for.   I think most of us would be surprised at what we could afford if we skimmed down to the very bare essentials but we don\u2019t want to, or at least I don\u2019t, I like my Redbull and iPhone.",
    "follow-up": "The extranuous expenses is part of it, but some of those are actually COL things now. Basic society does not have the same minimum requirements of 50-70 years ago. It would be nearly impossible to get a job today without a phone. Not even a smart phone, just a phone.   Companies dont generally hire on the spot now, so you need to be contacted to be told you were selected. Thats on the given you went to a company, filled out an application since applying online is eliminated by no internet. (I acknowlege you could go to your local library to use their internet for application, and email notification, but unless you are going every day, you may miss the window of time a company expects you to respond).   Childcare. This is correct, our grandparents did not usually pay for childcare. This is because their generation saw almost exclusively single-income families. And that single income was able to afford basic cost of living for a nuclear family, which by todays standards is somewhere in the 40-60k range. So with 1 parent as stay-at-home, childcare is negated. Also, a big reason for many people eating out/ordering is fatigue. If both parents worked 8-10 hours, then dealt with kids and errands, the motivation/willingness/time available to cook a meal is gone. Look at the (both exaggerated, and SUPER excessive gender role isolation) classic examples of family dynamics on things like Leave it to Beaver, Pleasantville, That 70's show; wife wakes up, cooks breakfast and lunch for husband and kids, husband goes to work and kids to school, wife cleans up and then free to do whatever for several hours, then watches kids when they return from school, and cooks dinner to have available when husband returns from work. Even adding a pre-school age child doesnt change this other than flipping \"free to do whatever\" into \" take baby to park\". The cost of childcare PER CHILD in many places is often over $150/week. At minimum wage, that is 20 hours of pay, or half the pay (before taxes) for that same week of work. Add a 2nd kid, and it is now less than breakeven to work rather than stay at home and watch the kids for anyone on minimum wage.   As for the cake-batter-levels-of-sugar coffees and energy drinks, thats solid. They are an unneccesary expense. But i also like my red bulls so fuhh-Q.

Air can't hold as much heat energy, and it is also more of an insulator, so we hold on to our heat better.  But water will transfer heat much better, so even though 30C water is warmer than 25C air, we are warmer than both of those, and water transfers it better.

But yes, to a good extent our offspring can only develop, grow and mature so far within the confines of a grown adult. Despite one instance of a four year old getting pregnant and having a child at age five, generally there\u2019s a far higher survival rate for child and mother if they grow and mature to be capable of reproducing later while the child survival rate is also greater with parents who are older and more capable.  So it\u2019s all a case that the full development can\u2019t take place completely within the womb and continues outside it until puberty when the body recognises it\u2019s ready to have and care for children and goes into a rapid development and change phase to prepare for that.",

    "answer": "So speaking from some experience, an old friend used to stomp his heroin with fentanyl purchased as a \"research drug\" from China and shipped to a drop house. He was 100% an addict and the reason he was cutting was he was taking his \"pure\" heroin he received, holding a large percentage back for his own use, and selling the stomped on product as \"pure.\"   Problem was his supplier had the same ideas and used **carfentanil** to cut it before passing it down to be sold. My friend does his usual and shoots up a hero dose and the rest is in the obituary. [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/drk74iJ) reference for how small of an amount of these synthetic opioids is considered a lethal dose.  **Edit:** Because jesus, didn't expect this to blow up.  To clarify, friend in question was my half brother, who unfortunately got me on drugs in the first place. I've personally been clean since 92.  He started off slinging pot for the mexican mafia back in the late 70's and branched off to coke and speed in the 80's. The wake up call (for me) was when he got shot in the head during a bad deal and managed to live. (The bullet skidded off his skull and bounced around in his sinus cavity before exiting by his eye.)  I'd like to say he turned his life around at that point, but he didn't. We fell out after he started using what he was supposed to sell. (Found this out when people showed up at my moms house and held a gun to her during a family dinner.) He pops up every 5-6 years \"clean\" and we catch-up just for him to disappear again. Last time he popped up around 2013 was when he tried to recruit me into his scheme and basically laid it all out. He was dead within the year.  Edit#2: As mentioned his H was white, he didn't sling black tar or that brown shit from the middle east, his words; \"My shits pure, I get it from the Asians.\"",

    "answer": "Not sure I fully understand the question. If you mean why muscles tire after lifting heavy weights, it's because of lactic acid buildup. Muscles produce intense energy in short bursts through an anaerobic process that burns glycogen and doesn't require oxygen. The tradeoff is that it cannot be sustained for long periods of time and the muscle is overwhelmed by lactic acid.  On the other hand, aerobic exercise allows muscles to produce energy using oxygen, which can be sustained for far longer periods of time before reaching exhaustion.

    "answer": "Are you asking why water *casts* a shadow? Like on the bottom of a pool and such?    Those aren't shadows in the traditional sense of light being *blocked* by something. Instead, water causes refraction.....when light hits water it slows down, this slow down changes the direction light is traveling.    In the case of a pool, the surface often has some waves to it...even if they're really tiny waves and it looks completely still it's likely still moving to some degree. This movement causes light to constantly be drawn in different directions as it passes through the surface of the water. This constantly changing direction of light acts almost like a disco ball, causing high and low amounts of light to hit different parts of the floor at the same time, which causes dark and light spots to appear, creating \"shadows\".    ELI5: Water rarely sits still and is always telling the light to go a different way. The light does what it's told which causes bright and dark spots to appear.",

    "answer": "It was difficult to understand your question but now I do.  World wars are defined as a global war involving the multiple influential nations all engaged in a black and white fight.  They\u2019re very rare because the type of conflicts or events that trigger a world war require very specific rules.  In order for a world war to occur, all influential nations must be able to fight. They must have the economy to support the financial needs of warfare and they must have a viable army to sustain the large combat.   Alongside this, all the nations involved must have a clear and non-ambiguous reason to fight for. For World War 1 it was in retaliation to an assassination and World War 2 it was against nazis.    World War 1 was a special case. It\u2019s what would most likely happen today. If 2 majorly influential countries went to war it triggers a world war automatically because of the complex network of alliances that all countries have.  If US is attacked, the UK will aid the US. This will trigger all of NATO. This will then trigger most of Europe and also India.  If the country that attacked the US is China, then Pakistan will join, which brings a good portion of Middle East into the warfare as-well, and if Ukraine is involved, by default, Russia will be sucked into the warfare too.  Most countries, if not all, understand this. So they fight from their desks through economical sanctions or by giving guns to terrorist groups who either blow up buildings in the other country or fight the terrorist groups backed by the other country - otherwise known as \u201cproxy wars\u201d.",

Plasma: gas that has been stripped of outer electrons - typically done by making it hot or by funny a current through it - and now has an electric charge.  Gravity, electricity, and magnets: gravity isn't related to either, as we currently understand it. Electrons have a magnetic field, which forms loop-like curves in one end and out the other.

    "answer": "There's a lot of hardware that you'll pass through, and most of it you have no way of even knowing.  You can only find out *approximately* how many routers your packet touches on the way to its destination because of a fancy hack of setting the TTL to various incrementing values(which decrements with each router until it reaches 0 to prevent routing loops), and getting TTL Expiry messages back from the router that sent them.  However, that doesn't even tell you the number of routers, since technologies like MPLS let a service provider create a pseudo-routing-shortcut through their network from one edge to another, which can bypass the TTL mechanism in the intermediary steps.  Then you have various switches and signal boosters along the way, which are also going to be transparent.   At the same time, you could be going through \"virtual\" devices. You could have a packet go into a Layer 3 Switch on one Virtual LAN (VLAN), which passes between two Layer 3 Routers within the switch, and then out another VLAN on the switch. Topologically, this could have been 4 devices, but it's actually just one.",

    "question": "ELI5: What's the source of light scientists talk about?",
    "answer": "The speed of light is quite poorly named, to be honest.  Think of it more as the speed of reality.  If I make a change to the universe HERE you will see that change happen when that reality - moving at \"the speed of light\" - reaches you.  It doesn't matter if that change is a physical object, a light beam, gravitational pull, radio waves, whatever... the \"reality\" of it having changed moves outwards from that event at the speed of light.  If you were 1 light-year away, and I turned on a torch, you won't see that torch turn on until my reality expands out to meet yours, which will take a year.  If you were 1 light-year away, and I died, you couldn't ever possibly know that I'd died until the reality of my death has expanded so far that it touches your reality.  There's no way to \"cheat\" it by sending a message announcing my death ahead, it would only ever reach you at the speed that the reality of the event expands.  If the sun disappeared into nothingness this instant, being 8 light-minutes away, it would take 8 minutes before Earth suddenly WASN'T being pulled by the Sun, and stopped orbiting.  We wouldn't know the Sun had gone optically for those 8 minutes either.  Those 8 minutes are how long whatever-is-happening on the Sun takes to reach the part of the solar-system we live in.  This is why when we look back at stars, we can say that a star is as it appeared a million years ago, etc.  We know that because they are a million light-years away.  Hence the \"reality\" of whatever happened to that star hasn't reached us until a million years later.  That star is probably long dead and gone.  The speed of light is the speed of reality.  It's really the speed limit of the entire universe because of that.  NOTHING can go faster than reality itself, but reality isn't instantaneously everywhere.  It takes a while for the reality to catch up and expand out because the distances are so vast.  If you \\*could\\* go faster than the speed of light, you could actually get somewhere, and then look back and watch yourself leave on that journey.  And the \"you\" that left would have been able to see the \"you\" that's already there, before you leave!  It basically turns almost into time travel, which is paradoxical and therefore we believe it's just not possible to do.  You would be able to send a radio message to yourself in the past, and things like that, and we don't think that's \"allowed\" in physics without everything breaking.  The speed of light is just called the speed of light, light is just an incidental example of it.  Think of it as the speed of \"reality\" and it starts to make much more sense.  Around a black hole, for instance, gravity has so curved space and time that the reality of whatever happens inside the black hole cannot ever make it out the black hole.  Hence we know nothing about what happens inside a black hole and anyone inside of one knows nothing about what happens outside.  It basically \"chops\" the realities in two, and they never meet again.",

    "answer": "There would be no way to route traffic efficiently without IP addressing.  The only way it's done efficiently is by knowing based on network address where to route your traffic.  Think of it more like sending something in the mail, vs a phone book.  You need multiple pieces of information to get it to the right place right?  You need Zip Code (US), State, City, Street Address, and Person.  You mail that piece of mail from one side of the US to another, the first thing they do is look at that information to determine how it's going to get to it's destination.  You can't just put a name on there, as there is no way for the mail service to know that name out of the 300 million people living in the US.  So they start with ZIP code (which is really smaller than state), then narrow it down by street address, then eventually when it gets into your mailbox your wife hands you the mail because it ends up with your name on it.  Same way IPs work.  The numbers are not just randomly assigned.  Network address space is reserved by classes.  And routing tables know where those addresses are assigned to.  We know that everything 8.x.x.x is going somewhere, and everything that 9.x.x.x is going somewhere.  Then, as it gets closer to the destination, we use the additional digits to pinpoint where it's going until we get to the last digit and then we have the server.  Also, its VERY important to know, that name does not equal 1 server or IP address.  For example, when you go to [google.com](https://google.com) you go to 10000s of servers, not just a single server with a single IP address.  Also, for smaller setups, 1 server can house multiple IP addresses.  I have 5 domain names hosted on a single IP address.  That's why you can't just go to a name.  Really the name gets resolved to an address (or one in a pool of addresses), and then when you hit that server your browser says \"Hey, I'm trying to get to [myfavoritedomain.com](https://myfavoritedomain.com)\" and the web server serves it up.",

Magnetic strip is trivial to clone, but for a chip this is extremely difficult, and for all practical purposes impossible. This means for someone to use your card, they'll have to physically steal it from you. The moment you notice your card is missing you just cancel it. Also they can't be used for \"card not present\" purchases online.   2. You have to be a registered person/business to accept contactless payments. There was a worry that people would go around skimming money from people's wallets with a contactless card reader.

What we call \"light\" is actually only a tiny part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum, which is another name for \"all the possible wavelengths photons can have\". But it's the only part where we have sensory cells in our eyes that react directly to photons (we can kinda feel photons outside of that range on our skin, but what we actually feel is just how our skin gets warmer as it absorbs them).

    "question": "ELI5: How does light have momentum if photons have no mass? Momentum is mass times the acceleration (p=mv), so something with no mass should have zero momentum.",
    "answer": "Good question! Let's think of momentum as the idea a moving object has energy it can transfer to another moving object through a collision. For things with mass, one object speeds up and the other slows down after a collision (or their velocities change, to be more accurate).  With light, we see that light can hit an object with mass, change its velocity, and the deflected light will be red-shifted (indicating it lost energy). If we look at the system as a whole, the change in the momentum of the deflected object will match the energy lost by the photon. By our momentum definition, that means the photon had momentum and then transferred it to the object!  More generally, we can describe momentum due to an objects mass (p = mv) and momentum (energy) due to its wave-character (p = h/lambda or hf/c [since lambda = c/f]). All matter has wave character (as described by its de Broglie wavelength), but for massive objects, the wavelength tends to be so large it's unobservable and the contribution to momentum basically rounds to zero (especially next to the large momentum of an object with mass).   Usually we worry about this \"dual character\" with electrons, which have both mass and wave-like characteristics and we need this relativistic explanation of momentum to better understand their behavior.  This idea that light has momentum is how solar sails work. Even if individual photons have very, very small momentum compared to a massive object, the sun makes a lot of them and overtime it can push around small objects like probes!",

When identifying the bars you should be listening for the first downbeat of the bar which is often emphasized. So you would count 4/4 as **1**\\-2-3-4-**1**\\-2-3-4-**1**. And this is usually audible in the music. It does not always sound as obvious as in for example waltz but after some practice you should hear this in most songs. And when you listen for this and also for any rhythmic repetitions you should be able to identify a bar and then just count how many beats there is in that bar.

Except unlike a really big Platinum credit card, they have to issue government bonds instead. That's the debt we're talking about.   Run a budget deficit to pay for covid relief? That's debt the government has to borrow. Invade another country? More debt. Cut taxes for the wealthy but maintain spending? More debt.  Government debt isn't necessarily bad. i.e. sometimes even in a balanced budget, there are cash flow issues. Government has to pay employees year round, but only gets paid during tax season. And sometimes you want to spend more NOW and pay it back LATER. Its when a government has so much debt it can't make its _interest_ payments - that's what happened to Greece in the banking crisis bunch of years back. Greece had borrowed from Germany, France, UK etc. and could not pay them back. So they were forced to not only balance their budget, but reduce it further (\"austerity\") to be able to pay back their debts.  Who owns it? You and I own it. Banks own it.

For example 1+1 it will find the least significant digit by doing True XOR True which is False meaning that the number ends in 0. Then it finds the carry bit by doing True AND True which is True. Since there is only one digit in the input numbers the carry is put last and you get a result of 10.

    "answer": "Yes, that's precisely it, in a sense.  Games run at very fast speeds, often times more than 60 frames per second. That means, the GPU has less than 16.66ms to render one frame at 1920x1080 resolution, or the game will start to dip below 60 FPS.  Now, have you heard the commonly circulated internet fact that a single frame of Frozen took a week to render? So how do we do that, but in 16ms? The answer is that engineers created \"hacky\" ways to render your game that are in no way physically accurate, but will produce okay-ish results really quickly.  One of the most difficult things to simulate with these \"fake\" methods are reflections. Because well, reflections are inherently a byproduct of realism. Light bouncing around multiple times makes things reflect off each other. We certainly cannot afford to do that kind of processing, otherwise it would take longer to render the frame, and we don't want to play games with the FPS of a slide show.  But the engineers are smart, so they created special methods to once again \"fake\" the reflections. For example, [cube maps](https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced/cubemaps_skybox.png)! These work by pre-rendering beforehand the reflection of the world around the object, and then drawing a texture based on that rendering. So, when you play the game, it's simply just drawing a texture, not rendering multiple bouncing light rays. The downside of this method is that it does not allow dynamic reflections, because the textures are already pre-rendered beforehand and cannot change.  With ray tracing, like the name implies, games are able to draw light rays (simulating light bouncing) more realistically, and hence draw real time reflections and such, but without much more effort. This can be done with the help of the novel RT cores that Nvidia developed in their 2xxx and 3xxx cards.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why are long haul trips like airplane rides and bus rides so exhausting, even though all we do is sit?",
    "answer": "One important consideration is the constant body position. Sitting around the house when you're relaxing, you'll be shifting positions periodically, leaning forward, leaning back, bearing more weight on your hipbones or your thighs, lifting or crossing or uncrossing your legs, etc.  A long car or plane ride doesn't give you nearly as much freedom to do that. The sitting position is pretty rigid, and you might be able to lean the seat further back or more upright, but that's typically about all the freedom you get. Add to this the fact that you're actively balancing even as you sit, if there is any wobbling, bumpiness or G-forces on the ride. You can't fully relax in a car because muscles in your back and abdomen are constantly responding to the little lateral forces produced by handling the car. Depending on the size of the plane and the air conditions, the same might be true on a flight.  Finally, the sensory input can be mentally exhausting. Highway driving is noisy, and can expose you to pretty fast-moving visual scenery which, even if you're not really paying attention to it, your brain might be noticing and spending some energy on. Planes in flight are also very loud places to be. That can wear you down and push you toward mental fatigue.",

    "question": "ELI5:What are \"wrapped coins\" (wEth, wBTC, ...) ?",
    "answer": "Back in the 2017 crypto bull run, bitcoin was really expensive to send around because of the network congestion but sending eth around was super cheap. Since eth allows you to do smart contracts, you can make an eth token called \u201cbitcoin\u201d (or \u201cwrapped bitcoin\u201d so it doesn\u2019t confuse people), and essentially lock up an actual bitcoin in a ethereum smart contract and send around that eth token (called eth wrapped bitcoin) instead.   The real bitcoin is still there, gaining or losing value, but you can send around your eth token and pay minimal eth fees instead of sending around that actual bitcoin.  Fast forward to this bull run and people made jokes how it should be bitocin wrapped eth now (since eth fees got pretty ridiculous). This can\u2019t happen quite yet because bitcoin can\u2019t do smart contracts.  It\u2019s basically a bridge between chains. So you can use any coin on any network.  Edit:  I\u2019m going to add to this because I\u2019m obsessed with crypto and want everyone else to be as well.   You may see tokens like cETH, aUSDC, or CAKE-LP (as opposed to the actual assets: ETH, USDC, or CAKE). These are called proof of ownership tokens. You can look at them like receipts.   For example, let\u2019s say I have some USDC (US dollar coin), and I want to get interest on my USDC. To do this, I deposit them into a lending pool (let\u2019s say I use the Aave protocol). Once they leave my wallet, I get aUSDC (Aave USDC) in return. This is an absolutely amazing and overlooked feature of crypto. This aUSDC I have is just as valuable as the asset itself + any interest it\u2019s generating. If I sent you my aUSDC tokens, you can withdraw all my usdc (and any accrued interest) out of Aave. This allows the usdc holder to not only gain interest in the Aave lending pool but now take that \u201creceipt\u201d and use that value somewhere else to generate even more passive income.   Uhhhg I could go on but then I\u2019ll for sure be treading on waters that are too difficult for 5 year olds if I haven\u2019t already >.<  Dm me if you have any questions! Always happy to explain more :D",
    "follow-up": "Since you're a crypto enthusiast, could you explain the reasoning behind it? From an economics point of view crypto is at best a store of value (assuming it's relatively predictable).   I think my econ prof explained it best with the gold coins vs silver coins example. When there were gold coins and silver coins, people would hoard the gold, and spend the silver. This was because silver was relatively abundant and more was entering the supply each day. As a result of the influx, silver devalued while gold didn't. Applying this to crypto, we have fiat currency and crypto, even assuming that crypto tames volatility, it's still just another gold, except you can argue that gold has intrinsic value from being useful, whereas crypto is just a thing that exists.  I don't see what crypto is supposed to do, it's advertised strengths are, security of value, and freedom of capital.  However, store of value only works when there is relative stability, which there isn't. And even if there were, it still holds no advantages over gold. Additionally, transitioning to a crypto based currency system would mean national governments lose the ability to pursue expansionary fiscal (and monrtary) policy, resulting in every economic downturn hitting like it was 1929. The freedom of capital is also dubious since, the blockchain is made up mainly of large operations as opposed to the grassroots vision of people with their GPUs. If crypto were a mainstream commerce tool beyond a speculative thing, it would once again be dominated by institutional players like banks, and with a digital medium they can probably pull as yet unthought of schemes.",

    "answer": "So essentially, in the ocean and seas, water is constantly evaporating.  When it evaporates, it's mostly salt free, as the salt doesn't go with water vapor.  It turns into clouds as it gathers together, then goes inland and rains.  Man made desalination works similar.  Except accelerated and in a much smaller surface area.  We heat up the water.  That causes it to evaporate quickly, and we collect the water vapor, and get fresh water.    The residue of the man made desalination process is very salty water.  Which gets pumped back into the ocean, and can cause issues with the area it gets pumped into getting too salty and killing off everything.  The limitation is cost.  It takes a huge amount of energy to heat up water to produce enough fresh water to be usable.  That huge amount of energy is very expensive.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do words stop sounding like words when thought about too much?",
    "answer": "When you say or think of a word (for example, \u201cpink\u201d), it creates a sensation in your brain. That sensation is electric impulses traveling from neuron to neuron in a specific, complex network that your brain accepts and registers as \u201cpink\u201d. However, during the travel of the electric impulse, your neurons release certain chemicals, and those chemicals need to be restored. This is known as \u201creuptake.\u201d  Thus, when you first think \u201cpink,\u201d all the neurons used to create that thought are all strong and ready to give you a nice, strong, comprehensive, and clear idea of pink. However, after immediately triggering those neurons over and over and over, while your neurons are still in the reuptake process, they get, \u201ctired out\u201d in a way, and aren\u2019t all able to perform as expected.   Duly note; neurons firing is like a gun firing; they either do or don\u2019t. They can\u2019t half fire and create a weak image. Instead, the idea of pink gets less and less clear as less and less neurons are working to create the image until they all \u201cpass out\u201d and you\u2019re left thinking \u201c...what IS pink?\u201d",

    "question": "ELI5: How is electricity physically measured (like at the meter on my house)?",
    "answer": "Maybe not ELI5, but here you go.  Electricity is the flow of electrons.   Electrons flow because they are pushed by a *voltage*. The voltage is like the pressure causes water to flow in a pipe.  The amount of electrons that flow is termed the *current*. The current is like the flowrate of water in the pipe.  More voltage (pressure) = more current (flow).  So if you want to talk about flow, you might say there are 10 electrons travelling past a point every second (electrons per second), just like how you might talk about water flow in litres or gallons per second.  If you want to find the total volume of water, you take the flow and multiply it by time. So if you had 10 litres per second, after 100 seconds you used 10\u00d7100=1000 litres.  Same for electricity. You take the amperage, and multiply it by time. We could do electrons per second, but we use Amperes to measure current. We also use hours instead of seconds.  So what do you get when you multiply Amperes and Hours? Ampere-hour (Ah), which is what you see on your electricity bill. The ampere-hour is the amount of electricity you used.  Now we know how you measure time, but what about current?  Inside your meter is a *current transformer*. This consists of a metal donut that surrounds the main conductor going into your house. A copper wire is coiled around the donut.  The electricity going through the main conductor is AC (*alternating current*). Now when electricity flows, it creates a magnetic field. When that current *alternates*, so does the magnetic field. So you have an *alternating magnetic field* surrounding the main conductor. This fluctuating magnetic field causes magnetic field lines to pass through that copper coil in your little current transformer, and that *induces* a small current in the copper coil.  This copper coil is connected to a smarter device which includes an ammeter which measures the current. This is then used to calculate the current in the main conductor.  The current \u00d7 time calculation is done at small intervals and added together to account for varying loads.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why are high impedance headphones hard to drive yet low impedance hifi speakers require a more powerful amplifier to get them to perform optimally?",
    "answer": "High impedance headphones are a result of the much thinner wires that make up the voice coils which drive the membrane in order to keep them as light as possible. These extremely thin wires are of much higher resistance because resistance is a function of the cross sectional area of a conductor. Because power is voltage squared divided by resistance you need more voltage to increase the effective output power which is what makes them \"harder\" to drive. If the output circuit isn't compensating the sound will just be much quieter.  Speakers on the other hand are about massive displacement of air. The lower the resistance, the more current, the more power at the same voltage, the more powerful an amplifier you need. So if you go down from 8ohms to 3ohms you've nearly tripled the amount of current those coils can handle so you need almost triple the power so you need a much higher wattage amp to drive the speaker.  In short, high end headphones require more voltage to drive them to compensate for the resistance of smaller wires while high end speakers allow more current due to the lower resistance of the wire.",
    "follow-up": "Aren't headphones also about the displacement of air though just on a much smaller scale compared to speakers? I understand the principle of greater resistance needing more voltage to get the same level output for headphones. I still don't understand why lowering the resistance means more input is needed for speakers though as this seems to be the exact opposite way to how headphones work? Surely 1 volt into headphones with a resistance of 30ohms is going to give a much louder output than headphones with a resistance of 300ohms, so why is it the other way around for speakers and a more powerful amplifier required?  Edit: just to add that I've played around with the calculator linked below to see if I can understand this. My amp is rated at 60w at 8ohms or 120w at 4ohms.   At 8ohms fed by 60 watts we get 2.73A and 21.9V. At 4ohms and 120w we get the same volts, but current has increased to 5.47A, so effectively doubled. A few questions on this then: Is the increase in current the reason why a better quality amp that can handle the higher current is needed at lower resistances even though it should be easier to push the current through and if so, why? Is the power going to the speakers determined by the number of volts being fed into them and in order to keep the voltage up as resistance decreases more current is needed? If I'm correct with both of these then why isn't current an issue with higher resistance headphones, or is it?   https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/electric/watt-volt-amp-calculator.html",

    "answer": "Cutting out a tumor is something doctors can try to do but in only works in specific circumstances. Many types of tumors can communicate with the body and request blood vessels be built to them and consume resources meant for other organs. In addition, they grow virulently and can grow around critical blood vessels and organs making it essentially impossible to cut out the entire tumor without risking killing the patient. Sometimes the tumors can grow and kill off the cells that form the walls of organs complicating the removal process. If even a single cancerous cell is left behind and not destroyed by the body - it can grow back into another tumor, so it can carry many risks.  Lastly, the most dangerous types of cancer are tumors that actively spread freely throughout the body. Cells can break off and float throughout the body and embed themselves elsewhere growing new masses simultaneously everywhere in the body. At this stage the tumors are likely inoperable - the only way to fight them is chemically or via other means.",

    "answer": "There are different types, but one uses sodium acetate dissolved in water. It's a super-saturated solution, meaning that really there is more stuff dissolved in the water than the water would \"like\". So the sodium acetates \"wants\" to start come out of solution and form solid crystals. To start growing a crystal, though, you need a *nucleation site*, some little bit of something that the first sodium acetate molecules can latch onto and then gather into a crystal from there. Without a nucleation site, the sodium acetate stays in its super-saturated solution.  The hand warmer packet contains this solution along with a little strip of metal. If you bend this strip, little bits of metal come off and these provide nucleation sites for the crystals to start growing. This crystallization process is an *exothermic*, i.e. heat-releasing, reaction.  How did the heat get there? Well, to create a super-saturated solution, you need to dissolve the sodium acetate in hot water (which can hold more stuff in solution) and then let it cool. Some of the heat you put in gets stored in the solution - the heat that was necessary to get it super-saturated (in other words, the solution reaction was *endothermic*). When the excess sodium acetate crystallizes, the heat energy stored in the solution is released.  As to why it is safe, you can calculate how much heat energy will be released and thus how  hot the hand warmer will get. So you can ensure that the temperature will be in a safe range. There's no danger of a \"runaway\" reaction since you know exactly how much sodium acetate you dissolved and how much solution you put in the packet.",

    "question": "ELI5: What does the concept of entropy mean?",
    "answer": "The most intuitive way to think of entropy is to consider it as a measure of how disordered a system is.  For example, consider a fresh pack of cards. It's in one order and one order only, and it's very easy to tell when the deck is no longer in that order. The fresh pack has very low entropy, because there's only the one arrangement it can be in.  Now, if you shuffle the deck, so that the cards are completely randomized, you've raised the entropy of the deck. You can rearrange the individual cards very freely without damaging your ability to say \"Yes, that's a shuffled pack of cards.\"  Another way to think of entropy is the ability to pull useful work out of a system. For example, you need a temperature difference to do any work with a heat engine; if there's no gradient, nothing's going to want to move from point A to point B. You need *low entropy*, a condition of order and being able to say \"This is different than that,\" in order to perform work.",

But what if Jack later discovered a pattern to his shuffling that allowed him to predict where each card was. Would the deck no longer have entropy? Or did it not have entropy to begin with because there was a pattern (one that Jack didn\u2019t know about).

    "question": "ELI5: Given the many layers of checks and balances in the court system, how can 1-5% of innocent people end up in prison for crimes they didn\u2019t commit?",
    "answer": "Human error has a lot to do with this, really. Even after taking out all the biases people have in general, such as accusing someone based off their physical appearance, and a lot of circumstantial evidence making a case, you'd still get those wrongful convictions (probably a lot less, but you'd still get them.)  There are two major causes of these.  The first one is the fact that human memory is complete and utter garbage, and can be modified by repetition of alternate facts. This has been proven time and time again, where a police officer repeatedly smashing you with facts about a crime you didn't commit, may lead you to believe you actually did.  This further extends to dubious and faulty memory of events. Many wrongful convictions depend on witnesses misidentifying the culprit, as their brain sees the accused, and if they look close enough to the actual culprit, they will identify them as if they were, because minute differences do not register unless you put the two side by side. Likewise, other details may be super vague, and mis-remembered or misquoted. Often, all you remember is \"the man robbed a bank, and he looked a bit like this\", because your brain needs to remember this for survival reasons, but the rest of the details won't even be remotely in there. This explains the reason why if you are in a similar situation to a crime, you will be also suddenly a bit more anxious, as if the crime was about to happen again. Survival instinct is a fickle thing that hurts all this stuff.  And then, we get to the second major cause: Plea deals. This one is probably the biggest culprit, and it basically goes like this.  You get arrested for (let's say) drug trafficking charges. You know you didn't do it, but somehow, they found a pound of cocaine in your car. While you're struggling with the confusion of \"how the hell did that get there\", and \"who the hell do you know might have left it there for you to be screwed over\", an officer comes in for interrogation, and tries to coax a confession out of you. They say they found the cocaine, they say that through a few contacts, they have witnesses to say you're guilty, and to boot, they found your fingerprints on the cocaine's bag.  After a few hours of back and forth and forth and back of you telling them you wouldn't even know where to get cocaine, and them saying that they have all this evidence, the confession is only a formality at this point, but they still want it, because \"confessing goes a long way in reducing your sentence\", since it means you admit and know that what you did was wrong... Well, they drop in the bomb: If you admit that it is your cocaine, they can drop the charge from drug trafficking, to drug possession, whose sentence is much lighter, so that's sort of meeting halfway. Tired, annoyed, and honestly just wanting to be done with this, you accept the deal, write and sign a confession, and they send you either to the station's cell, or home (often with bail), awaiting the formality that is the trial.  At this point, they have everything they need: They have heavily circumstantial evidence, that is corroborated by you confessing. Suddenly, you get a year in jail for a crime you don't even know how to commit, because honestly, it's better than the alternative of being in jail for drug trafficking... And that's how you got wrongfully convicted.  That kind of scenario happens a lot more often than you probably think, with more and more police officers being caught planting evidence they \"find\" in a car they are ssearching (often illegally) thanks to their body cams. This can also land the same way with murder, but the steps that have to be taken are very different, since there isn't really a step down they usually get you to in order to get there.  Those are the main two culprits of wrongful convictions.",

    "answer": "> And then you can modulate the wave so it carries data. For digital modulation, that means you vary the amplitude or power level of the transmission.  And/or you can vary the frequency or phase. In FM transmission, you would change your 2400MHz signal up or down by up to 10MHz, and your 'bandwidth' would be just that - your band width, the difference between the lowest and highest frequency you're sending.  Other modulation schemes which use phase and amplitude together are in use too. One example is [QAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation).  If you're transmitting a digital AM signal by pulsing a single carrier frequency on and off, then your bandwidth is the result of a tradeoff based on how fast you're pulsing on and off relative to the frequency of the carrier wave. If you're pulsing a carrier wave on and off very fast, approaching the frequency of the carrier itself, then the spectrum of what you're sending gets quite wide. If you transmit a pure 2400MHz signal at constant level forever, never stopping or starting, then that would be a 0 bandwidth signal, a pure frequency. But when the signal is stopping and starting, the band gets wider than 0. This is just a mathematical consequence of how frequencies work. A great video to get intuitions about this is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBnnXbOM5S4",
    "follow-up": "Thanks, I think I am a little less confused now. Phase modulation is something I hadn't thought about.  So... in simplest terms, the more the frequency of the carrier wave is allowed to fluctuate, the higher the bandwidth? Yet that's \\*not\\* frequency modulation, but... something else?",

Think about something that angers you and your muscles will tense.  Or, more easily, you can will your arm to move.  Your mind isn't some ethereal thing separate from the physical structures in which it exists. Your thoughts \"are\", in a physical sense, your experience of the electrical impulses and chemical states of the neurons in your brain. And those neurons are connected to neurons in others areas of your body that control things like the release of certain hormones or the contraction of muscles.",

I read about someone who had persistent, debilitating cramps every month, but learned to ignore them and continue functioning most days. Then one day, her vision faded and she was completely blind. Her eyes were fine, it was a psychosomatic symptom. Since she was no longer responding to the pain signal alerting her to a problem in her body, the brain started flicking other switches to try and get her attention. Once the pain was treated, her vision returned.  To answer the original question a bit better, when you're anxious, the brain starts trying to figure out what's wrong with you, be it a physical issue or a dangerous situation. Usually when it can't come up with anything, it gives you a stomachache (those organs are so densely packed and busy, it's impossible to tell which one is causing a problem, so if theres a problem the brain can't find, it blames it on the abdomen). But if you're anxious about a specific disease or ailment, then you're giving your brain a new thing to blame. \"Worried we might have lice?? We must have lice! Go itch!!\"",

Adhesive of that kind is meant to never 'set' or harden, so it's already soft to begin with (in a semi-solid state), and that means it's melting point is likely not much higher than room temperature. As the temp in the room rises, the adhesive starts to undergo a transition from semi-solid to full on liquid which loosens the protein chains that are holding everything together, which causes the weight on the Command Hook to be enough to release the bond.

If you look at semiconductors you describe them with negative electrons and positive holes that both can move around.

Mass is a property that particles can have, its a way for energy to be stored but not the only way and not all particles have mass.  Most things you deal with are large and are made up of massive quantities of particles which all have mass so most stuff you think of has mass, but the light from the sun doesn't have mass but it can still push things because a photon's energy is in its momentum (not mass*velocity but a more intrinsic momentum).

Photons have momentum but not rest mass which forces them to travel at the speed of light, nothing with mass can reach the speed of light without infinite energy and nothing without mass can travel at any other speed.  Basically the universe has a set of fields that things interact with.  The electromagnetic field interacts with charge and magnetism, its force is carried by photons.  The Higgs field is what gives things mass, its force is carried by the Higgs boson.

You're black because white people decided that \"black\" is a thing, and decided on how black people should be treated by society.  Black people are not given the _option_ of choosing for themselves, of being treated the way white people are. They can't say \"please don't shoot me officer, I'm white actually\".  So should white people have the option to shop around and go cosplaying as black people (but only ever have to experience the fun parts, while preserving all the privileges you get with being white?)  Being \"transracial\" is really about white people saying \"those black people who used to be our slaves? We still own them. I can still take anything from them that I want. I can take whatever I want from their lives and experience it for myself without giving anything in return\"",

What does it mean to \"identify as a woman\"?  Does it mean you're more likely to get pregnant?  Does it mean you're more likely to get breast cancer?  Does it mean you're more likely to have a period?  Does it mean I'm more likely to be sexually harassed by men?  If not, then what does it mean to \"identify as a woman\"?  >Gender is just about you.  According to who? Why is gender only about you but race is somehow about everyone else?  >Being black isn't really about the individual. It's about the systems. It's about the family you grew up in, the opportunities you are (or aren't) given, the way you're treated by the authorities and so on.  So if I had black skin but I was adopted by a white family, I happen to have had good opportunities, and I live in a community where I'm treated well by the authorities, etc. would that mean I'm not black? Suppose our society treated all races equally. Would black people stop existing? Because your whole argument seems to imply that being black is defined by being treated like shit by society.  >Black people are not given the *option* of choosing for themselves, of being treated the way white people are. They can't say \"please don't shoot me officer, I'm white actually\".  Ok suppose I could actually \"pass\" as a black guy. Suppose I could alter my looks in such a way as to convince others that I'm black, just like plenty of trans women have surgeries and hormones to make them \"pass\" as women. If I could make myself look black, I'd expect a racist cop to treat me just as poorly as any other black man. So with that reasoning, if I can convincingly pass as a black man, would that make me trans black?  >Being \"transracial\" is really about white people saying \"those black people who used to be our slaves? We still own them.  A lot of people say the same about trans women. Plenty of trans people are accused of having ulterior motives. Why is it ok to assume a transracial has ulterior motives but it's wrong to question the motives of transgender people? And why are you assuming that it's just white people wanting to be black? What if a Native American guy identified as Asian?",

For wheel web spiders, the basic concept is pretty simple really.  Flying insects essentially ride airstreams like a surfer rides waves. That means the best place for a web is across some sort of airflow.  Luckily there's a really easy way to achieve that. The spider starts by letting out an initial guideline in the draft until the airflow picks it up and the end of the line sticks somewhere. When that happens the spider will cut the end of the line it was letting out and attach it where it's sitting. Presto, the spider now has a line crossing a gap.  Now the spider just has to cross that line to create a number of spokes and then create the connecting lines between the spokes.  Spiders can do this pretty quickly really. A very productive web will be repaired and cleaned but an unproductive web will often just be abandoned if it breaks or clutters up. This means that every night, a lot of spiders are trying their luck by building a web someplace new. Most spiderwebs last a few days at best.  And while spiders had millions of years to evolve these clever webs from humble beginnings, the first bicycle appeared only 204 years ago. Spiders really can't conceptualise the notion that a giant will show up to ride a piece of terrain down the street.",

They still feel like they go through gears though for efficiency of the engine to run at optimal torque and hp based on the speed and incline and throttle.",
    "follow-up": "High perfomance cars however often still need an actual gearbox as CVTs usually work with a belt drive that wouldn't withstand the immense power and torque of some modern day cars.   Why do they need different gear ratios at all though? Well, in the case of trucks there is a lot of mass unwilling to be moved and you will need a lot of force to start moving it. The force your vehicle produces is a function of torque and its mechanical advantage. With a high mechanical advantage, you can get 40 or so tons rolling and shift into the next gear to accelerate, shift into the next gear, accelerate and so on. With cars the reason nowadays is either similar to trucks or they are chasing better 0-100km/h // 0-60mph times.   A noteable exception would be the Koenigsegg Regera I think.

At a disc manufacturing plant, a master is used to stamp or etch physical pits into a disc.

An actuator arm moves to different locations on the spinning disc, and the magnetic polarity of each microscopic sector determines the data.  SSDs store electric charge in NAND flash cells.

    "answer": "A snow storm is just heavy rain. It looks way more impressive because snow is so much more bulky, but most snow storms clouds just look like rain clouds.  Thunderstorms are very high energy cumulonimbus clouds that normally require a large quantity of high humidity high temperature air...that's usually not conducive to snow, at least at ground level, it's too warm. You can easily get below freezing inside a storm (that's where hail comes from) but if the ambient temperature is below freezing it's hard to get high enough humidity to power a thunderstorm.  If you get very specific conditions it can happen, \"thundersnow\", but that's pretty unusual.",

    "answer": "Basically it's a number pattern where each sequential number is the sum of the prior two:  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 etc.  Or  0 + 1 = 1;  1 + 1 = 2;  1 + 2 = 3;  Etc.  Taken alone, it seems arbitrary and boring, but the ratio of each number pair gets closer and closer to a very special number in nature called phi (pronounced fee), which is also known as the golden or divine ratio.  Just as the greek letter pi represents the (approximate) value of 3.14 and is a special number relating to the circumference of circles, phi, which represents a value around 1.6,  has an odd way of showing up in all sorts of natural phenomena. We see this ratio in spirals, such as the spiral of a hurricane, the spiral of the milky way galaxy, or even snail shells. We see it in the proportions of our own anatomy: the ratio of the successive digits of your fingers, or of your hand to your forearm is approximately 1.6 etc. There are many more examples if you do a Google image search for the golden ratio.  Then universality of this relationship lead philosophers to regard it as almost like gods calling card, an artifact of the divine source code that created the natural world (hence the divine ratio). A more secular argument would say something similar but drop god from the equation and say it has something to do with fundamental forces that govern the physical world.   Regardless of the explanation, it seems generally accepted that this ratio is related not just to physical phenomenon but also to our perception of physical beauty. As such it is often utilized in art, especially after the the renaissance, with lots old old famous paintings incorporating the golden ratio. even contemporary marketing firms attempt to utilize it in brand logos, believing it a sort of shortcut to creating an aesthetically pleasing image (the new pepsi logo is an example of this approach in marketing)  Hope that helps!",

    "answer": "Materials are made of atoms.    Each different type of atom, compound or molecule interacts with light differently.  This is mainly because of how their electrons are arranged around the atoms and molecules.  Some compounds absorb some frequencies of light and not others.  The atoms in glass used for windows don\u2019t interact with visible light because their electrons aren\u2019t arranged in a way to do so. But they do absorb UV. That\u2019s why they\u2019re good for windows!  Other glasses are good at absorbing X-rays and so are good to use in X-ray machines.  Things to google: electronic band structure & optical absorption",
    "follow-up": "I've read through all the comments and I like this one the best because it is the ELI5 (and therefore, doesn't use the p word), and I'd like to elaborate a little for those who may want a bit more. Reading OPs question I infer the context to be \"glass\" as in window.   When we describe why I can see through a window there are a couple of things that are inferred but perhaps not obvious, and in an ELI5 therefore must be highlighted. I'll try to do that now.   In this particular branch of physics that deals with the problem OP asked there is a property of materials called \"the index of refraction\". It's a property that's indispensable in describing what will happen when light and things interact with each other and what the outcome is. That IoR property has a lot of factors that go into determining what value it is for each type of object that light might interact with. Things like what is the object made of, how are the molecules arranged, for example, but many more factors that are advanced. The point is every material object has this IoR property and it can be found by looking it up in a table. Is that good enough?! Absolutely!! It's the same level of detail and importance as when I say this brick weighs 10 pounds. You don't have to think about how much is because of this or that, or what amount of 10 pounds is due to the energy of this or that bond type. Nope, it's all shrink wrapped for you in that one number. Understood and accepted by all...it's no different than IoR when dealing with optical phenomenon. One hyper important factor that's baked into that IoR value is geometry! Geometry? Yes! It's never said because it's understood by people in the field, but is utterly not obvious for those not in this field. The geometry of the object shape is \"cooked\" into the IoR!!! That's factor #1. The other factor is colour of light. Unlike something like weight, the IoR will be different for each colour, be it red, ultraviolet, whatever, for each individual material! So for each material type, and each colour, there is an IoR. That's factor #2 (geometry and all other factors are baked in there too, remember). Now, lets address the question OP had.   IoR is used to tell us/calculate whether an object is transparent or not and because the colour of light is relevant, when we look up IoR for air and glass we can figure out how much gets through \"STRAIGHT\" with our particular geometry!! This is going to sound cold but when we look up window glass the IoR and planar shape of panes means we will \"see\"/calculate a result that's transparent...at many particular angles. If you look through your window at certain angles and certain coloured objects the brightness or reflection amount changes, i.e. not as/more transparent. I can literally look at my big window and find spots where it's almost completely opaque and if I take a step to the right that same spot of glass becomes transparent. Different colours, different angles can mean different transparencies and it can all be expressed in that Index of Refraction number and angles of attack.  That is how light/optics \"works\"! Any answer more sophisticated (including explanations using the p word) will have to account for all I've written and much much more.",

    "answer": "Beekeeper checking in - queens are produced from the same egg as workers.  The egg selected to be a future queen is fed more royal jelly which changes her physiology when she is developing.  Once born, she will battle any other queens to the death.  She then matures for about a week, then flies off for mating.  She typically mates with 15-25 drones.  After returning to the hive she will start laying eggs within a week or so.  At here peak she will lay approx 1,500 eggs per day.    Workers are all female, but do not typically lay eggs.  They have different types of roles in the hive based on age. In rare instances they will lay eggs, but since they never mated, the eggs are all male.  Drones are males with no father, but a grandfather.  They do no work to improve the hive.  Their only function is to spread the genetics of the hive.  They are driven put of the hive in the late fall since they have no value at that point.  Honey is nectar that is collected, concentrated and processed with enzymes.  A forager bee brings the honey into the hive and passes it to another worker.  They then store it into a comb.  During this time enzymes in the bee start processing the honey.  Once stored the comb is left open until the concentration of water drops to around 17% and then it is capped.  Workers live about 6 weeks, unless it is winter and they can live up to 4 months in the hive.  Queens live 2-4 years assuming they are not killed by another queen.",

For my part, I think it's clear that quantities of things exist independently of our being around to count them, so at least the most fundamental elements of math are inherent to the universe. I don't think it would be possible to have anything approaching an understanding of the world without at least *some* math, so it is essential in that sense.   That said, the world exists, the universe was created in the Big Bang, galaxies and all other celestial bodies evolved, an atmosphere formed on some of them, and life flourishes in an enormous variety of forms all without anyone doing a single formula.

The whole procedure is more symbolic than anything else. Now, you may ask how the country can still exist without current members of Parliament? In reality, most of the government is run by the departments, and those remain unchanged. Parliament only meets a few times a year, so this period of dissolved parliament might go unnoticed in terms of actually running the country.

This creates efficiency at high cruising speeds for better gas mileage. It only takes about 15 horsepower to keep a car going at speed, while it takes many more ponies to get up to that speed.

When you need to replace the foundation, the worker will find the major \u201cload\u201d points (the places in the support structure where the weight of the load, the house, is being supported at) and use very strong steel to instead act as the support as opposed to the previous foundation (concrete slab or otherwise).

    "answer": "Inflammatory pain/everyday pain: NSAIDs, typically ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) are most common. Can cause problems such as ulcers, bleeding, and kidney problems.  Everyday pain (particularly in elderly) : acetaminophen/paracetamol (Tylenol). Can be hard on the liver.  Arthritis pain: when the OTC pain killers don't cut it, other NSAIDs such as meloxicam (Mobic) or celecoxib (Celebrex) can be used. Easier on the stomach, harder on the heart.  More intense pain: injectable NSAIDs like ketorolac (Toradol) (really hard on kidneys) or opioids.   Nerve pain: not many great options, but gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), and a class of antidepressants called SNRIs (duloxetine and venlafaxine are the parent molecules) can be used. Methadone has also been useful in certain cases.   Centralized pain: this is a weird kind of pain where there isn't necessarily anything wrong, but you've been in pain so long that the pain center of your brain misfires and tells you you're in pain. Very hard to treat, but treatment is similar to nerve pain.   Migraines: NSAIDs can be used OTC. Generally people need something stronger and will be prescribed a triptan (sumatriptan, rizatriptan, etc.). There are a bunch of new and interesting drugs that just came out that treat and prevent migraines.   Tension headaches: A mix of an NSAID or acetaminophen, caffeine, and phenobarbital.   Cancer pain: generally opioids. Can step down if the pain isn't too bad.   Bone pain (usually associated with bone cancer, chemo, or bone marrow transplant): can use zoledronic acid and/or an antihistamine like Claritin or Zyrtec. This is generally in addition to opioids or NSAIDs.   These are the ones I can come up with off the top of my head. It's been awhile since my palliative care and pain management rotation.",

    "answer": "Firstly the main purpose of a space station is to do microgravity research. Launching a big expensive space station just to simulate Earth conditions would be counter productive in this setting.  There have however been a few suggestions for how to create artificial gravity by spinning up parts or the entire space station and create centrifugal forces that simulate gravity. There are however issues such as possible oscillations, how to dock with such a space station, how to interface rotating and stationary components, etc.  In fact there was a big centrifuge module constructed for the ISS. The purpose was to be able to simulate Lunar or Mars gravity for research programs, test out designs for centrifugal space stations, conduct control experiments in space, and so on. But due to issues with balancing such a huge rotating mass inside a fragile space station it was limited in size and was not big enough for humans, only rodents and plants. Sadly due to issues with funding and delays in the construction of ISS this module was parked in a parking lot in Japan and have not moved in over twenty years.  There is currently some suggestions for one of research missions with the new cheaper spacecraft that have come on the market the last decade. The plans usually involves tying a long tether between the spacecraft and the upper stage booster that put it in orbit. This configuration could then be spun up using the thrusters and therefore generating a nice stable simulated gravity at very low cost. This could be used for low gravity research, something we currently are unable to do, or even to create gravity for transit missions to Mars.",

    "answer": "When we first are learning to do something, we have to expend a lot of conscious attention on it. Once we get used to something, we can basically \"downgrade\" it to automatic sub-conscious actions, like muscle memory.   When we get used to driving, we can do the basic steering & operation of the vehicle essentially automatically...we don't need to focus conscious attention on it. As a result, the thing we \\*are\\* consciously focusing on (our \"locus of attention\") can wander to other things that don't involve vehicle navigation. When you suddenly pay attention enough to ask \"Where am I?\" you don't have any continuous stream of position like you would if you were paying attention and have to figure out where you are. Until you do, you literally don't know where you are.  Allow me to stress that basic operation of the vehicle is \\*not\\* the same as \"driving\". Driving safety \\*requires\\* conscious attention because you need to be constantly looking for threats and assessing how you might avoid them, which you can't do automatically.

Microsoft does not yet make available a consumer version of Windows compatible with Apple's M1 chip. Pro: the OS is running natively on the hardware, making full use of the hardware. Con: a computer can only run one operating system at a time, so you have to reboot to switch between them.  Parallels Desktop is virtualisation software. It creates a pretend computer, within which you can install and run another operating system, like Windows. Pro: you can switch between Mac OS and Windows seamlessly and without rebooting. Con: it's virtualisation, so performance can suffer.  So if you want the Boot Camp experience while using Parallels...just reboot your computer every time you want to run Windows inside Parallels. I don't know why you'd want to do that, but you do you. It will still be virtualised of course, since Windows cannot natively run on the M1, so you still have the performance hit.  CrossOver is completely different software. It implements a compatibility layer to allow Windows apps to run on non-Windows operating systems. Basically when an application runs, it expects certain functionality to be provided by the underlying operating system - drawing a GUI to screen, accessing file, talking to hardware, opening network connections, and much more.  Different OSs mostly provide the same functionality but you need to talk to them in different ways. CrossOver sits between the application and the OS and translates those Windows function calls from the application into something the underlying Linux/Mac/Chrome OS can understand and perform. The reason not all apps works is that compatibility layers are rarely perfect, they are trying to exactly copy all of the functionality provided by an OS which is not fully documented, and will have weird quirks or edge cases, without having access to the source code of the OS.",

And there will be a point of saturation after which no matter how much spice you add, it won't get 'spicier'. That would be considered as its true heat.",

    "answer": "There have to be parts underneath the bread to stop it from falling all the way down into the crumb tray.   That would be bad because it means you'd have to carefully clean the crumb tray before making any toast or else one edge of your toast would have old, stale, burnt crumbs stuck to it. Also, that edge of your crust might toast differently than other edges since it was resting on a solid surface.  For the most part, it doesn't matter if you have crumbs \"stuck\" on various structural bits of the toaster. But if the tray wasn't there, it'd be hard to get the crumbs back out. You'd have to turn your toaster upside down over a trash can, shake vigorously, and pray. That'd probably do more to get crumbs stuck on every random part of the toaster than you've observed happens with the current setup. As is, 90% of the crumbs end up in the tray and if you jiggle your toaster a little the rest will fall.   It's a situation where \"good enough\" is just fine.",
    "follow-up": "I\u2019m not talking about the sort of slatted lever the bread sits on, attached to the handle, which slides down when the handle is depresses. Beneath that, between the crumb tray and the toast at its nadir, there\u2019s like these fixed metal fins. Now that you and several people have answered, I can kind of see how the shape of them aims to funnel crumbs through the central area onto the tray, but it still seems highly inefficient.   Leave the slatted lever/bread rest, leave the crumb tray, remove the metal fins that conduct crumbs into the tray? Or is there something I\u2019m missing? (I\u2019m assuming that whatever mechanism that holds the bread in place when the handle is depressed is dependent upon the side of the toaster frame and not the bottom, but perhaps I\u2019m mistaken.)",

    "question": "Eli5: What's Laplace transform?",
    "answer": "In math we have groups of numbers that share properties. For instance integers are the group of numbers that can be written as whole numbers like -1, 0, 1, 2 and so on.  One of the most often used groups of numbers are the real numbers. These are the numbers that are generally used in real life. They can be integers, rational numbers like 1/2 or 5/11, or even irrational numbers like pi or the square root of 2. Most functions that people use in real life take in a real number and give you back a different real number.  However, there are also things called complex numbers. These numbers have a real part, and an imaginary part. This is just a different kind of number. A laplace transform turns a function with a real variable into a function with a complex variable. These functions won't be the same, but you can go back and forth from real to complex then back to real.  There are some math problems where converting into the complex function simplifies the problem. So we convert to complex, then solve the problem, then convert back to real.",

    "answer": "Earth rotates VERY slowly relative to its size. Once a day, which is twice as slow as the hour handle on the clock. The speed of the surface doesn't matter, humans can't feel the speed, we only feel the change in speed, which is acceleration. And by rotating once every 24 hours the change in the direction of the speed is very small. Earth also rotates very uniformly and to same direction, so even with faster rotation, it would just feel like the gravity is weaker.  This is called centrifugal force, which can be calculated for the earth:  [https://i.imgur.com/PSXL6K5.png](https://i.imgur.com/PSXL6K5.png)  So if we put a human on the equator and calculate how much the centrifugal force of the rotating earth makes the human lighter, it's about 2 newtons of force, which is about 200 grams lighter on earth's surface. If you would weigh yourself at the equator, you would weigh tiny bit less than on poles (if ignoring other factors).",

    "answer": "The process of healing surface wounds has a really cool name: epithelialization ([pronunciation](https://www.google.com/search?q=epithelialization+pronunciation)). Scientists who have studied this process observed that [it happens more cleanly and efficiently when the wound is kept \"wet\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3842869/). In this context, wet doesn't mean wet like under water. It means a mechanism is used to prevent the body's natural fluids from drying out. In other words, preventing a scab from forming.  Neosporin is mostly petroleum jelly, plus some anti-biotics. Interestingly enough, the anti-biotics aren't the primary source of improvement in healing; it's the petroleum jelly. In fact, many dermatologists (skin doctors) advise against using anti-biotic ointments like Neosporin because the anti-biotics can cause allergic reactions.  You can get very similar results by following these steps:  1. Flush the wound with soap and water immediately. Yes, this will sting, but this is the best way to disinfect a wound while preserving the live tissue. 2. Apply an anti-biotic ointment during the first application of a bandage. 3. Change the band-aid twice a day. Once when you get up, and once before you go to bed. Apply regular old petroleum jelly instead of anti-biotic ointment.  You'll get the same results, you won't risk any allergic reactions to anti-biotics, and you'll preserve the efficacy of anti-biotics against future infections. Prolonged exposure to anti-biotics actually contributes to resistance in populations of bacteria.",

    "answer": "Most mammals aren't finished in seconds, they often do take several minutes. From a biological perspective you don't want to cum TOO quickly because there is a strong chance of wasting it while not actually having sex, or ejaculating before penetration, so most mammals are a minute or two at minimum.  Then there is a popular theory that the shape of the penis is supposed to work as a shovel to help remove the sperm of a females previous partner. This would indicate that the initial portion for sex in humans at least is to help remove rival males sperm from the female. If the shovel theory is even partially correct than it would seem reasonable that an extended period of sex would increase the likelihood of passing down those traits.  This does hold some merit when you compare the sex durations of gorillas, who have a very strict hierarchy so competition for females isn't based on sex, resulting in the smallest penises of any primate and only around 1.5minutes of sex on average.  With that said, Bonobos, our closest living relatives and the most sexual of any primates only last about 10-15 seconds and have similar penises to ours. This might be because they are so focused on sex though that if they were to last longer they would end up prey, and not pass down their genes.",

    "question": "ELI5: How do rich people hide money in off shore accounts and why can't everyone else do the same ?",
    "answer": "A lot of the focus on this thread has been on \"how do you move money offshore\".  But there are a few other ways rich people avoid paying taxes that I haven't seen in this thread yet.  1. Imagine you have a construction business in the US.  You go build something, you get paid $10M, it costs $9M to build the thing, $1M of money flows through to you, you pay US taxes on $1M.  Now imagine that in addition to your construction business in the US, you have a shell company set up in the Cayman Islands.  Your US business gets the contract to go build the thing for $10M.  But now, in scenario 2, your US business hires your Cayman Islands business to do the work.  Your Cayman Islands business charges your US business $9.95M.  Now only $50k flows through to you in the US, and you pay US taxes on the $50k.  Your Cayman Islands business still had to spend $9M on building the thing you got paid $10M to build, so it has $950K left that it earns now as 'corporate profit'.  In the Cayman Islands, that $950K has 0 tax applied to it.  In this scenario, your money is now \"stuck\" in the Cayman Islands.  However, your Cayman Island company that has $950K can buy various things you might be able to make use of (houses, jets, etc.)  Your usage of those things is technically taxable in the US, but it can become hard to enforce. It can also invest the money to make more money, and no taxes would be owned on it until it was distributed to you. 2. Minimize your state tax bill by 'residing' in a 0 state tax state.  There are 9 of them - Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.  Most very rich people have a home in at least one of these states that they claim - rightly or wrongly - is their primary residence.  The Tri-State area (NY, NJ, CT) and California have tried to clamp down on this, but in the end, if you can avoid spending 180 days in those states, you're home free of state tax. 3. Minimize your federal tax bill with loss carry forwards and depreciation expense.  This was a big one for Trump, but is widely used.  Any assets you own, including commercial real estate, you're allowed to depreciate over a 'useful life'.  That depreciation counts as an expense - even though no cash was spent - against the income you pay the federal government.  You can also offset your income with other 'investment' losses, that can sometimes be creatively finagled.  The IRS frowns on 'creativity' like this, and most of it is borderline illegal or completely illegal (but not all - if you invest all your money in GME for fun, you'll be able to write that off eventually), but, enforcement is low since the IRS has such a low enforcement budget. 4. Never realize your profits from investments.  Similar to #1 where a shell company in the Caymans lets you delay realizing profits, there is a tax loophole called the **1031 exchange** which lets you delay realizing assets from property.  It was partly closed in the 2017 tax bill (for all assets other than real estate), but of course was left open for real estate by our real estate developer president.  With 1031, say you bought a house in 2000 to rent out (and you have your Cayman company to manage it, so they keep the profits from rent).  It makes a bunch of money every year, you invest some of the money back to make the house nicer, it still depreciates some giving you some tax write-off, etc.  Fast forward to 2021.  You paid $1M for the house in 2000.  You put $2M of improvements in over the years from rental income.  The market is now red hot, and the house is now worth $10M.  If you did your accounting right, you now have $7M of capital gain ($9M if you didn't).  BUT, if you sell the house and use the money to buy another house or other piece of real estate for $10M, you owe $0 in taxes.  You can get even more creative, and sell your business as a piece of real estate (in certain circumstances) to use this loophole.  For example, I know of a case where a film studio was sold as a real estate transaction.  There was absolutely real estate involved (they needed somewhere to shoot), but part of the value of the 'real estate' was the business that ran within it (including contracts to shoot in the studio, and the studio's reputation or 'good will').  The studio gets sold for $100M or $200M or whatever it was, but it gets called a 'real estate sale'.  The ex-studio owner then had 45 days to identify $100M+ of property to buy - so he bought dozens of houses in a few very hot rental markets.  He avoids paying taxes on his big sale, and now has rental income (which comes with depreciation write offs, and can be directed elsewhere).  &#x200B;  Why can't everyone do the same?  These structures cost money to set up and some require playing games with real estate, which has high barriers to entry.",
    "follow-up": "> BUT, if you sell the house and use the money to buy another house or other piece of real estate for $10M, you owe $0 in taxes.  I follow you until this point.  If I'm just going to buy another $10M property, what does that \"buy\" me? I can't use the money from the first sale for anything consumable; the money is still locked up in a property. Best I can tell, I would have been just as well off not selling the first property?  The only thing I can think of is if I really wanted to move into that 2nd property all along and just happened to get lucky in the \"long game\" after two decades. Is that what this is all about?",

    "answer": "This is going to be a simplification - feel free to check out [Richard Feynman explain why this is hard to explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8):  As an abstract concept, a field is a thing that has a specific value at every point in space. For one such example, there is a field that describes the distance in inches everywhere in the universe from a cup of coffee. This field varies as cups of coffee are created, consumed, or moved around. While this may seem contrived, it still meets the criteria to be a \"scalar\" field - a field with a single number at each. One such real field like this is the Higgs Field - related to describing the distribution of mass in the universe.   Fields can also have multiple values at every point, for example in 3d space this could be a direction. The gravitational field is one of these, every point in the universe has some direction that gravity would pull on a small mass at that point. Fields are useful tools because often they can exert forces on the things that interact with them - just how a one mass is pulled towards another because their interactions with the gravitational field.   The magnetic field is just another vector field where the value at each point encodes the direction and strength of the push on an object that interacts with the magnetic field - such as moving charged particles, electric currents, or magnetic objects. When we say that an object has \"a magnetic field\", we mean that this object influences the values at all the points in the magnetic field near the object where a stronger magnet changes the values more.  The magnetic field is especially interesting because its relationship with the electric field, as changes in the magnetic field cause changes in the electric field (the direction/strength of forces on static charged particles) and vice versa, a principle that makes generating electricity possible.",

Her ideal world was laissez faire capitalism: the less government involvement in capitalism the better. For example mandated minimum wage would not exist, and while that sounds like a bad thing, she would argue that it would still exist in reality because no one would accept a job that did not pay enough to feed them; government interference would actually drive down the wages by artificially tying them to fixed point that would not scale with inflation or cost of living.",

The short answer to why they claim they can test hundreds of different reactions is they use IgG tests (*not* IgE tests, which are commonly used by allergists), which looks at the relative amounts of IgG antibodies for the foods they test. The theory is if you have a high number of antibodies, you may be sensitive to that food.   They test for the antibodies by exposing the blood to samples of the food, then check and see how many antibodies attached to each food tested.   If I understand correctly, unlike some other blood tests this means you are only using up blood that reacts to the food samples (presumably with some waste), since they will not attach to food they do not react to, and as such you don't have to \"use up\" as much blood",

The reactants have a higher energy than the products, so the formation of the products is favourable because they are more stable, however, the way from one to the other isn't straight down, they must pass through a higher energy intermediate to arrive to the final point. They need a kickstarter, a little bit of energy to then cascade directly to the other point. This is called activation energy.  Edit: I just didn't think straight for a second there.",

    "answer": "Ok so it\u2019s a foundation principle in physiology that water follows salt. So, ingest lots of salt, like salt water, and the water will leave your cells to flow to the high salt area.   Now saline solution is water that has salt added to it to match to normal concentration of salt in your blood. So we are introducing normal fluid to the body that\u2019s dehydrated, which causes water to enter your cells, since the dehydrated cells have a higher salt concentration than the saline fluid.   Electrolytes, like Gatorade, key off a type of cell transporter in your intestines that moves salt and glucose together. They activate this transporter to move the salt and glucose into your body, out of the intestines, and cause water to passively enter the blood, leading to hydration  Hope this helps",

If you fail to pay, the bank will be screwed. At best, they lose $150,000 by selling the house at $300,000. Much more likely, they will have to sell lower than that.

In a gas engine the file is sprayed or diffused into the air as it's pulled into the cylinder, in a diesel the fuel is sprayed in when the cylinder is about the top of stroke and the air is compressed. In a gasoline engine you add a spark from a sparkplug, to ignite the gas vapor. In a diesel the heat from compressing the air is enough to ignite the fuel vapor in the cylinder.   Once you light the fuel on fire, it explodes, forcing the piston back down, turning the crankshaft.   As the piston reaches the end of stroke another set of valves in the cylinder head open, these are exhaust valves. They are basically connected to the tail pipe. The piston comes back up, forcing the burn air out of the exhaust side. Near the top of stroke the intake valves open, this let's more exhaust blow out of the cylinder. Then the exhaust valves close and you're back at the start.   You add more cylinders doing the same thing at different times, so that it has more smooth power instead of all of them firing at once. That keeps the crankshaft spinning. You attach a flywheel to the back that is heavy and it will keep momentum going once it's spinning, smoothing out the operation even more. Then you attach whatever you want to run to it.   Can go into more detail or a single component of you want. But that's the basics of it.",

However, it does have an angular momentum, and that angular momentum can be in two different directions, up or down. You cannot rob the particle of that angular momentum, and you cannot give the particle more \"spin\" than it always had.   Because this angular momentum is governed by similar physics to classically spinning bodies, we named this property \"spin\".

    "answer": "Keep in mind that P2P is an architeture that is implemented at application level, so only the app knows that it is P2P, how the connection is made isn't changed. So, when you use an application that uses server-client model, the connection between you and the host is the same as the connections you make with P2P applications. The difference between server-client and P2P, is that on a server-client, the application will try to connect with a central server (that generally runs another appliciation dedicated to answer the requests of the client), while on a P2P, the application doesn't have a central server (there's the hybrid architeture, as well), and the application can act both as a server and as a client.     A) Yes   B) The same way you connect to any site, like reddit.    C) You need to download the torrent file. That file contains the metadata so the torrent application knows where to find seeders, and how the file is structured.    D) I think you are imagining that P2P is like a literal direct connection between your computer and the other person's computer. Any data that you send over the internet will go through many servers until it reaches the destination, \"direct connection\" doesn't mean the data will go from your computer, and only travel by cable without passing by any routers, and servers, it only means that users exchange data between each other, instead of them sending requests to a central server.     A good analogy is thinking of sending a note in class to your friend on the other side of the room.     P2P is when you pass the note to the person next to you, and ask him to pass the note to your friend on the other side of the room. Each person will pass the note to the next person until it reaches your friend.   Client-Server would be the same situation, but imagine that there's a 3rd friend, and for some reason you need him to read the note, and then send the note to the friend on the other side of the room.

The extra tissue is thought to provide greater insulation for the eye and sinuses from the effects of cold, especially from freezing winds, and to represent an adaptation to cold climates. That means that in extreme temperatures, their faces would be more protected from sub-zero temperatures which could freeze the nose, lips, eyelids and severely irritate and cause cold injuries to the sinuses. It has also been suggested that the fold itself may provide a level of protection from snow blindness. In extreme periods of cold, those who could see best in blinding sunlight reflecting off of snow and ice could hunt most successfully.  its appearance in peoples of Southeast Asia can be linked to possible descent from cold-adapted ancestors, its occurrence in various African peoples doesn't follow a cold-adaptive explanation for it appearing in the latter groups. The epicanthic fold found in the san African people has been tentatively linked to protection for the eye from the high levels of ultraviolet light found in desert and semi-desert areas.

    "question": "ELI5: What is Internet of Things mean (IoT) and how it works?",
    "answer": "Put really simply, \"Internet of Things\" is the idea that a lot of devices we use could be exposed to and controlled by a network and that this could be a good thing.  For example, having a lamp connected to the internet sounds silly to begin with, but it lets you create a remote control for the lamp. It's not that remote controls for lamps don't already exist, but they tend to use radio signals or infrared and both of these have line of sight and range problems. Having web-enabled doodads in the house means you can check if you left the oven on from the store and, if so, turn it off. Or, if you see a great deal on a roast while shopping but it's kind of late, you can start the oven preheating before you leave. Or, if you plan to arrive home after dark, you don't have to *leave* lights on, you can turn them on when you approach from outside.   The \"how it works\" is a bit of a mess right now. A lot of devices use their own special \"language\". For example, my fridge has internet-related features, but I can only control it from a specific app the manufacturer makes. My thermostat is internet-enabled, but interfaces with Amazon Alexa so I have more choices about how to control it. But there are some other \"languages\" that are more open, and devices that use those can be controlled from a lot of different apps or other devices.  There are lots of rainbow-tinted unicorn fantasies about how great it would be if every device were internet enabled. But whether it's a good thing or not really comes down to who implements it, how they implement it, and what they do with it.  For example, it'd be GREAT if my fridge could tell me its inside temperature regularly and how long it's running. Then I could use programs to perform analysis and notice if it seems to be malfunctioning. Instead, the only thing I can really do with the app is change the set temperature or get an alarm if the door is open for too long. Even if it had the features I wanted, it speaks its own language to its own special app so I couldn't access the data in a way that lets me use it.   Alternatively, my thermostat has both Alexa control *and* an API that I can use to access its data. Because of that API, I can write programs to analyze the data for me. I use a program someone else wrote to keep track of how my A/C is performing and to help me understand if it needs maintenance. This is a good thing!   Obviously people are concerned about security. There's a long way to go on that front.   In theory, some day, I'll be able to run ONE application that manages all of my devices. Where we are now, that's a bit of a pipe dream. Google has its own thing, Amazon has its own thing, Apple has its own thing, and a dozen vendors have their own thing. If you shop around you can find devices compatible with multiple, but those tend to cost a little more.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why are v8 engines over 5 liters in size common but i4 engines over 2.5 liters are very uncommon?",
    "answer": "I4 engines have excellent Primary Balance characteristics, meaning vibration due to the up-down motion of the pistons cancels each other out. It's easy to see why this works in animations of such engines.  However i4 engines have unusually poor *Second-Order Balance.*   Second-Order balance, also called secondary balance is related to the inevitable side-to-side rocking motion of the connecting rods. This motion causes the center of mass of the connecting rod to not move perfectly in sync with the CM of the piston. Rather, the connecting rod CM moves closer to the top surface of piston by a few mm, at the middle of the stroke then back again at bottom and top dead center. The term \"Second Order\" refers to the fact that this vibration occurs two times per revolution of the crankshaft.   What's worse, in an i4 these vibrations are perfectly in phase with each other with all 4 cylinders.  The fewest number of cylinders you can have and still have good secondary balance is 6.  I6 engines are inherently very well balanced. This is why many large heavily turbocharged diesel engines use this configuration.   At higher engine speed second-order forces grow in relation to the *square* of the crankshaft RPM, rather than in a linear fashion. This means that if you double the RPM the secondary vibration grows by 4x, and if you triple the RPM the vibration grows by 9x. So it's easy to see that this could lead to catastrophic engine failure to the tune of throwing a connecting rod in an i4.  To counteract this ~~almost all~~ (EDIT: *the majority of*) i4 engines have balancing shafts with counterweights that rotate at twice the engine RPM to prevent the engine from shaking itself off the engine mounts above, say, 2500RPM. Indeed most engines with less than 6 cylinders have balancing shafts of some type. This is far from a perfect solution with i4's since this still produces additional forces on the engine block between the crankshaft and balancer bearings that are less than desirable. The balancer shafts consume power themselves and result in higher vibration at idle speed. Their inertia reduces engine revving.   This brings us to the other prescription for the secondary balance problem, which is to reduce the engine redline. It's hard to get around this second part.   So, above 2.8L or so, you end up with a  Law-of -Diminishing-Returns relationship where larger and larger cylinders necessitate heavier connecting rods that cause greater and greater secondary vibration. This means you need to reduce the engine operating speed while using an increasingly heavy balancing shaft that consumes more power, causes more idle vibration, and induces more forces into the engine block between it's own bearings and the crankshaft main bearing. Thus, necessitating a thicker, heavier crankshaft and engine block. Beyond a certain point the fact that you're invariably forced to reduce the redline and increase engine weight in a way that's disproportionate to the displacement, wipes out any additional power you'd gain by increasing the cylinder size. Say, above about 3.5L  A V-8 deals with the secondary balance problem by operating each bank 90\u00b0 out of phase to each other, so that second-order forces in each bank tend to cancel each other instead of adding together constructively. However V-8s often use balancer shafts to counteract high RPM vibrations. The same can be much smaller on V-8 with respect to displacement, a V-8 with 6L does not need a balance shaft twice as large as an i4 with 3L. In fact a smaller one can be used in the former V8.  In V-6 engines there is good second order balance, but you have a moderate issue with primary balance.  A three cylinder engine does not have the outstanding primary balance of an i4, but it is better than a single cylinder. Specifically, in an i3 the uo and down monitions of the pistons to not always perfectly counteract each other. In a V6, unbalanced primary forces can be made to counteract each other best using a 60\u00b0 angle, but this does not entirely eliminate them. So V-6s have primary balance that is not quite a good as V-8's and they vibrate more. Again the usual solution is to reduce the redline RPM. Balancer shafts are also common on v6's  Another solution to the secondary balance problem is the one used by Karl Frederich Benz. He and his company produced the first flat-four opposed piston engine in 1900, using a boxer configuration that should ne familiar to fans of subaru, Porche, or VW cars.   These engines were used in Benz's racing cars, they had 5.4 liters and produced 20 HP, which was excellent at the time. The engines did not need balancer shafts at all and operated much more smoothly than the engines of Benz's competitors.  So why aren't flat-four boxer engines used on most cars? Well because they're significantly more difficult to produce and precision-assemble, and create a number of other less than obvious technical problems.",

This would be a worldwide financial catastrophe, as trillions of dollars in government bonds that the USA has issued over the course of many decades would instantly be worthless.  This is especially problematic since government bonds are supposed to be an extremely safe investment.  So trillions of investment dollars, that the investors were previously thinking were completely safe would be erased.  The repercussions of this are the same now as they were four years ago.

When people realized this, Hertz's stock spiked from the 50 cents it was worth, because after all it was believed that if you bought a share for say 1 dollar and after liquidation you would have gotten 2 dollars from the remaining assets, it would have been profitable even if the share ceased to exist afterwards.  In the vast majority of cases, Ch 7 bankruptcy happens when a company has more debt than assets though.

But once it's cold enough, there isn't enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds apart.

Hence, the memes:  https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*x7P7gqjo8k2_bj2rTQWAfg.jpeg  https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*mXeEWBymq-UXPXF2Oai5mg.jpeg  https://i.redd.it/4f71u8ti5hg31.jpg  What makes things more complicated is that ML is an extremely rapidly growing field, what it IS changes from month to month (usually growing). So it is kinda hard to tell the difference.  So here is my extremely simplified version:  * The purpose of statistics is that so HUMAN can understand the data  * The purpose of ML is to make PREDICTION.  For example, you are a CEO, and sales is down this month. If you want to know why, so you can do something about it, you get a statisticians. If you want to know what is sales for next month, so you know how much stock you have to order, you get an ML expert.  But here is a good example where things get complicated. Explainable AI and causal inference are definitely under ML, although they are supposed to answer the \"why\" question, on top of making prediction. There are also things like clustering, that also attempts to give human insights into the data.  A better explanations is that some tools, like neural network, are born out of the ML field, and regardless of what is used for. It will always be considered as ML, not stats.  ******************  So here's my summary. In the past, everything is stats. Then some people are interested in making predictions using the tools in stats, so ML was simply a subfield of stats. Then a number of ML specific tools (like neural network) were made. So now, anything that uses those tools, are considered as ML, regardless or purpose (e.g. XAI and causal inference). Worse, people are enhancing those ML tools with classical stats tools (e.g. Bayesian + neural network). In those cases, more often than not, the ML labels stick.  (I know this is a bad history, because ML is born out of CS and AI, not stats. But ELI5)  So, the distinction between ML and stats is more like the distinction between a main course and a dessert.

    "question": "ELI5: If I drink a glass of water and then urinate after a few minutes, am I pissing away the same water I drank a while ago?",
    "answer": "TL:DR Molecules enter-stay for differing lengths of time depending on factors-maybe get peed out-it\u2019s way more complicated than it should be.  Yay, something I know!  You drink a glass of water and it enters the esophagus on route to stomach. From the stomach  enters the small intestine which is a long and wildly bendy ride. Lots of nutrients from food are absorbed into the blood stream up to this point. After the small intestine the water enters the colon on its way out of you in the form of poop. The majority of water reabsorption into the bloodstream will occur in the distal colon (the section right before your butt) in the form of individual H2O molecules. So now the water is in your body for real.  Once the H2O molecule is in your blood stream it is pumped around your entire body by your heart. At some point it will pass through the kidneys where toxins, electrolytes, and water are removed. The kidneys are connected to the bladder via some tubes and the bladder releases its urine to the outside world via the urethra (the thin tube in the penis or vagina).  It\u2019s important to note that everything your eat and drink is absorbed into your body as individual molecules. So, a glass of water doesn\u2019t enter your body as such. It enters one molecule at a time. Each molecule will stay inside of your body for differing lengths of time; some get incorporated into cells or the fluid surrounding cells (interstitial fluid), some are sweated out, some are peed out, and some are bled out... And some don\u2019t make it in in the first place, they stay in the colon and are incorporated into your poop.   Fun fact: if you have kidney failure you become completely anuric (unable to make urine). In this case you will NEVER pee out the molecules from the glass of water. Instead, they will pool in the extremities causing swelling and need to be removed with medications or dialysis!",

    "answer": "A kidney is not like most organs.  You can have \u201cextras\u201d without them interfering in the daily running of your body.   Actually, extra kidneys is good!  You can only have one heart because of the way your body is laid out.  Your heart is kinda in the middle-ish of your body, and all of your blood *has* to go to your heart, make a detour through your lungs to pick up oxygen, and then swish around your body to drop the oxygen off.   If you had two hearts, this carefully-choreographed system just wouldn\u2019t work.  But kidneys.   Kidneys are special.  They\u2019re unusual.   They kinda just float in your abdomen, at the back.   Some people only have one, and some people have three naturally.  It doesn\u2019t make much difference.   Weird, right?  Kidneys filter your blood.   All your blood passes through them, and they push out the excess water and salt, and other dissolved waste products.   This trickles down into your bladder and you pee it out.  Now, you can pretty much attach as many of these kidney tubes as you like to your bladder.   So if a kidney still has some function, there is no reason to cut it out.   It\u2019s helping, even if it is not enough by itself to keep a person alive.   In a person with kidney problems, it\u2019s pertinent to give them every bit of help possible.   And you can have three kidneys with no problems at all.  That\u2019s why they leave it in unless it\u2019s literally dead or dying.",

    "answer": "An adult lizard will have 2 sets of chromosomes (diploid). When it produces the eggs, it does so by meiosis. The eggs will only have 1 set of chromosomes. But during the process of meiosis, the chromosomes mix and match with each other like patchwork. So the matching pair from the 2-set will divide into 2 sets of one, but they've exchanged some parts. This happens twice in meiosis. Either after the first or second round, an egg with 1 set of chromosomes will fuse with another to generate a diploid (2 set) viable egg cell. Since the chromosomes mix and match, there is diversity and the offspring are called half clones. The egg can also be later fertilized by lizard sperm from a different species, resulting in an extra set of chromosomes (3 sets total) and even more diversity.",

    "question": "ELI5: How do whiptail lizards maintain genetic diversity when they reproduce asexually?",
    "answer": "So the answer is a bit complicated, here is the ELI5. We are normally taught in school that reproduction works like this (in humans), Females have XX, males have XY, and the child is some combination of those X and Y chromosomes.  &#x200B;  Now, most people assume that you get one of two X chromosomes from your mother, and either the X or Y chromosome from your father. However, that would give you a tiny amount of 4 unique combinations if it was that simple. If you have ever known family that has more than 4 kids, you can tell that reproduction must be more complicated than that since you don't end up with \"duplicate\" kids.   &#x200B;  Now, whiptail lizards are special even among animals that asexually reproduce. Instead of a normal \"clone\" they basically are able to act like the mother and father. Imagine taking two eggs, (instead of an egg and sperm) and making an embryo from it. So it would be as if you had a pair of twins who had a baby together. Just like there are more than 4 options in human reproduction, a pair of twins would not necessarily produce identical offspring (for instance, both of them could have one dominant gene and one recessive gene. If they both contributed the recessive gene, their offspring would have 2 recessive genes, and look different).  &#x200B;  Now the genetic diversity is still less than you might expect in a sexually reproducing species, but it does allow the species to have more variety than you might expect.",

    "answer": "An inventor approached me with an idea of a  product that indicates if the seat is up or not. He asked me to design a product that will indicate if the seat is up with an LED light.   My first response was, sure I can design this for you, but why is this a problem that you think needs to be solved?  This was his explanation:  His wife, and and many of her friends, who are getting up in their age, have to pee in the middle of the night. So they go to the bathroom and sit down. Being half sleepy, and don't wanting to wake their husbands by turning on the light, they just go and sit down. And feel the cold porcelain rim of the toilet.  Women have to sit down to pee. Men don't. We men approach the toilet FACING towards it, so we see if the seat is up or down. So we see if the seat is up or down, and if it is down, we raise it and do our business.  But women, especially who are sleepy, walk backwards to the toilet, because they have to sit down. And they don't see the seat is up. Being sleepy, they sit down and feel the cold rim, which is not pleasant, especially at night.  I designed the thing, which was a small battery operated device that we put on the toilet lid, which indicated if the seat was up or down.   I don't think the product went anywhere. But this was the gist:  Men can see if the seat is up or down.  Woman may not, because they sometimes face the other way while sitting down.  So that's why it is polite to keep the seat down.  I thought the product was not that good, but I got paid for designing it. They got a a patent for it too.  EDIT: changed lid to seat, in some places, I was using the wrong words.",

    "answer": "During the last three months of pregnancy the mother's body will pass antibodies to the baby. This is called passive immunity. It is why DTAP vaccining (for whopping cough, tetanus, diphtheria) is recommended for pregnant women. DTAP is usually a ten year vaccine but it if you are pregnant it will be recommend every pregnancy because that way the immune system reacts to the vaccine and the baby will get the antibodies. If it has been a year or more than the antibodies might not be past on.  Anyway breastmilk is made from glands in the mother's bloodstream so the antibodies can continue to be past to the baby while being breastfed. If the baby is born healthy and full term their immune system is developed around 2 to 3 months of age. So they don't need mom's antibodies anymore. So you definitely want to keep on schedule with childhood vaccines because breast milk isn't an alternative to that.   Also in a controlled study called [PROBIT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11242425/) the short term health benefits of breastfeeding is thin.

Let's start with these. Telescopes are not far away. A telescope is a device which is either on Earth (99.99% of all telescopes), or in a few hundred kilometer orbit around Earth (e.g. Hubble), or planned to be installed on the moon (ca. 350 000 km from Earth, but none are yet in existance).

Say, in theory, people think if we have poor people, why not just print more money?  Because more money makes prices skyrocket as it doesn\u2019t hold its intended value any more.",

And what does this mean, is this the total value of assets by Dutch companies abroad? I'm fascinated!",
    "answer": "So we first have to understand what Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is. This is the dollar amount of foreign companies/people directly investing in companies in the Netherlands.  There are two reasons that the Netherlands ranks so high. First is that many of the bigger companies in the Netherlands are actually traded on stock exchanges in the EU. This artificially raises their FDI.  The other aspect is that the Netherlands has made it very attractive for people in other countries to invest. They have almost no financial regulations that would restrict it, and great tax rates to encourage it.",

    "question": "ELI5: What does life insurance mean?",
    "answer": "I can help as I have worked in the industry for a while.   The simplest form of life insurance works where an insurance provider will promise to pay a lump sum of money in the event of someone's death. Insurance providers charge a small amount of money for this periodically (the premium) in order to fulfil this promise.   Insurance providers work out how much money to charge by looking at things like life expectancy over large populations of people. They also invest the money they collect. The idea is that they will ultimately collect more money from people that don't die and make more in investment returns from that money than they will have to pay out for people that do die.   Sometimes people have very expensive lives. Think rock stars or football players or business executives. If these people have life insurance and they die, then the insurance provider could lose a lot of money. Instead of turning away the business, insurance providers can lay off some of the risk by getting other insurers to take up a portion of the payment if the high vaule lives were to die. This is called reinsurance.   This answer relates to life (term) insurance, but there are a bunch of other types like trauma, total and permanent disability, income continuity, all of which are offered by life insurance providers. Other products also operate as quasi investment products where even if the insured life doesn't die there is a payout at the end.   Happy to answer any questions about any element of this.",

    "answer": "That is basically an age-old battle between power generation and power consumption.  For solar energy you need space and sun. Lots of it actually, and while in some countries the weather pattern is enough for solar generation, in many countries solar energy on a private site like a normal house can only supply X percentage of your daily / yearly consumption. This is of course still a major benefit, hence more and more buildings incorporate some kind of regenerative system (even only to reduce normal energy costs by a few percent).  For cars however this is a bit problematic, as the space on a car roof is simply way too small to generate energy to generate enough energy efficiently enough to power batteries ... not even considering tunnels, bad weather, being in a garage or roofed parking lot, inside the shadows of skyscrapers in a city or a forest etc. You can optimize your solar energy generation at your home. You cannot do that nearly as good for a car.  Now in theory they can at least supply a bit of energy, but the next issue would be the price. For a building costing hundreds of thousands of EUR the price for a solar system is relatively low (compared to the building price). For a car, the relative price would be much higher, noticeably increasing the cars price ... and e-cars are trying to make their way in an extremely competitive environment, where even a few hundred EUR can already influence the purchase decision of a buyer.   Last but not least: cars are designed in their form and looks with specific goals in mind (good looks, areodynamics etc). Commercial solar panels cannot (yet) be brought into the form necessary for a seamless integration in the often curved roof or an engine hood. There are some developments where solar cells can be formed like plastics, but IIRC they are still a bit out of range of normal, large scale, commercial use.  In the end solar generation integrated into the hull of a vehicle will be coming, but only to supply some additional energy for onboard equipment like radios, lights etc.  SYL",

In a metallic substance, the electrons of every atom in the mass flow freely between every other atom. Essentially like a glass filled with ice and water. The ice cubes are the iron atoms and the water are the free flowing iron electrons.  When the iron atoms form a bond with oxygen, those electrons are no longer free flowing. They are fixed, more or less, in place between the oxygen and iron atoms and thus make ferrite (Fe2O3) a completely new and non-metallic substance.",

(Caveat: assuming the other stream doesn't depend on the stream of random numbers.) It *is* important to make sure you can't *independently* predict the output of the random number stream, because if you knew the random numbers in advance you could construct a source of entropy that perfectly cancels it out. But in that case, you can already predict the output of the PRNG anyways so you don't really have entropy to begin with. The only way for entropy to spontaneously decrease is if you have prior information about the system. (This is as true in thermodynamics as it is in computing)  The main challenge you face when designing entropy pools is figuring out how to measure the amount of entropy you have access to. The risk of bad entropy sources somehow \"drowning out\" good entropy sources doesn't exist - in practice, your only concern is that bad entropy sources might provide an incorrectly high *estimate* of entropy, so that something like a cryptographic key exchange protocol might go ahead with using random numbers despite lack of sufficient entropy to guarantee randomness of those numbers.",

This is actively depressing the economy and removing money from circulation, which leads to more deflation etc. So to play it safe, it\u2019s advised to target a bit on the inflation side, so there is a small but dependable rise in prices over time.",
    "follow-up": "This is the  \"correct\" answer from our Neoliberal institutions.  But more I think about it, the more I question it.    1. How is having people reduce their consumption and wait for the ideal time to buy something \"harmful\"?  It strikes me that maximizing the urge to consume is irresponsible as a long term policy 2. Additionally wouldn't falling prices favor workers?  Worker wages are far more sticky than the consumer products.  By having the prices rise constantly it forces workers to constantly negotiate from a position of weakness with their bosses or job hunt for a job that has kept up with the price of consumer products.  Meanwhile the opposite would forcer employers to make good arguments for reducing wages with their employees.  And as any economist will tell you, it is better that the person who is specialized in the job to do the job.  In other words it is better for a businessman who knows all the aspects of running a business to be the one negotiating a decrease in wages, than a worker who only knows his job to be negotiating a increase in wages. 3. All our governments tools to manage inflation have a bias towards the 1%.  When the Fed changes its overnight rate or buys/sales bonds, the elite are first in place to arbitrage the results, and the rest of us just live with how things shake out.  I am not necessarily advocating for deflationary or laissez faire policies.  But we have a had a mild inflationary policy since the 1930s.  Before that industrial output outpaced monetary supply grow decades and we had deflation (ie the second industrial revolution caused prices to fall).

    "question": "eli5: Why do commonly used items, such as CRT's or old consoles skyrocket in value after they stop production? Assuming that these items stopped production today, why do sealed boxes or hell even good condition second-hand items almost double in price mere weeks after the end of production?",
    "answer": "CRTs have some advantages over LCDs and other flat-panel display technologies that matter for certain niche applications. To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you're dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES's in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors' market will take years to get off the ground. The only exception I can think of would be if the manufacturer (for some atypical reason) stopped producing the console before they had exhausted the (profitable) demand for it (and didn't release a new console yet).",

    "question": "ELI5: why does squinting seemingly make stuff less bright, even if your pupil isn\u2019t being covered in the slightest?",
    "answer": "The whites of your eyes have little to do with what you actually see. The pupil of your eyes is responsible for receiving light and transmitting it to the brain to be perceived as vision.  Squinting changes the angle of the lens of your eye overlying the pupil, causing light to be refracted differently to certain areas inside of your eye, some of which are better at detecting brightness of light, while others are better at detecting color and overall acuity (sharpness) of an image.   If you wear glasses for nearsightedness (trouble with distance vision), you can actually improve your distance vision slightly through squinting -- it bends the light in a way that partially corrects the lens abnormality in nearsightedness. If you only have a mild case of nearsightedness, squinting can almost correct it entirely (but will cause eye strain and other issues doing it all the time). All your glasses (or contact lenses) do in these situations is add another lens with a correction factor to cancel out what your lens isn't doing properly and hence correct your vision.",

HOWEVER, this has little to do with calculating the \"due date\".   The *due date* is considered to be 40 weeks (not really \"9 months\") from the first day of her last period prior to becoming pregnant. The first day of that period is considered to be the \"conception date\".  More than likely, she actually became pregnant 2 weeks AFTER that, but whether you count 38 weeks from the ACTUAL conception, or 40 from the first day of the last normal period, you get the same date.",

Let's take for instance an ideal voltage step up transformer, it takes 12 volts input and converts it to 120 volts output, now Ohm's law comes into play to conserve energy. In order to step up the voltage the current must decrease  proportional to voltage change, from our example our input current will be reduced with the ratio 12/120 or .1, meaning 12 volts 1 amp in equals 120 voltages .1 amp out, the power remains the same.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why are we attracted to people's butts?",
    "answer": "Seems to be a combination of biology and beauty standards. Biology underpins perceptions of beauty, in the sense that what we find attractive tends to be what's good for reproduction, which is mostly health: clear, smooth skin means no diseases that cause skin blemishes. Long, silky hair means no diseases that damage hair growth. Nice arse means the person isn't malnourished.   Then on top of that you get cultural beauty standards. We form more specific details of what we find attractive by what culture tells us is attractive. Of course Freud is famous for his idea that everyone wants to fuck their own mothers. That was incorrect, but it touches on the correct idea that different cultures find different things attractive. For example, some but not all cultures find pale skin a sign of beauty, which isn't grounded in biology. A particular difference is noted in the difference between male beauty standards across the world. Europe and America tends to like big strong somewhat rugged men, but East Asia tends to prefer their men be boyish and pretty in a way we in the west might normally associate with women - cute, almost. And an emerging trend in the west is a fascination with colossal buttocks for no good reason.",

Maybe it's a capitalism thing: more money is better than less money therefore all things bigger is better than all things smaller? I wonder if people in non capitalistic societies feel the same?

    "question": "ELI5: What makes boobs boobs and not man boobs?",
    "answer": "Boobs are on anatomically female bodies, moobs are on anatomically male bodies. It's not much more than that.  Boobs form when the body has high levels of oestrogen, a growth hormone usually found in high levels in women and low levels in men. Oestrogen signals to the cells that they should grow into a female body plan, including growing breasts during and after puberty. Boobs are comprised of two tissue types - glandular tissue that's theoretically suitable for milk production (although won't actually produce milk until after pregnancy occurs), and fatty tissue.   Moobs can form as a result of unusually high oestrogen, in which case they will develop both tissue types and be anatomically identical to boobs (this is particularly useful medically, as it allows trans women to grow breasts by simply adding oestrogen to the system), but more commonly they're just a build-up of fat, in which the fatty tissues of the upper chest swell up in a way that looks like boobs, but no glandular tissue forms, which is  why fat moobs have a different shape to boobs. Although, fat does increase oestrogen production in the body, so a sufficiently fat person may end up developing small amounts of glandular tissue as a result of the extra oestrogen.",

    "answer": "Unlike, for example, VHS video tape, an audio track on a tape is recorded as a single \"line\" of magnetic material.

So the 'best' frequencies are the ones in the middle that can go pretty far and carry pretty much data. But all the radio frequencies kinda got assigned real lazy as new stuff got invented so things like music radio and tv got to take it all, and the military got the rest.      CBRS is a tiny tiny slice of spectrum the navy owned that it is giving to the public which will get used for some combination of wifi and cell phones. Which can have speeds like 5G but not need to do the 5G thing of needing super high power towers every mile.

Importantly, if plants took in too much sunlight they would be damaged by the excess heat, and if they took in too little, they would not get enough energy.

    "question": "Eli5: what exactly are magnetic fields, and how exactly do they do what magnets do?",
    "answer": "Imagine that everywhere in space is filled with little arrows that can be of different sizes and point in different directions. [This page has cool pictures demonstrating this.](https://mathinsight.org/vector_field_overview) All those little arrows are a field. Throughout all of space are different types of these fields. The magnetic field is one of these.  When you have something that's magnetic, it means that it has the property of affecting the field. It's affecting the size and direction of all those little arrows. [Example image.](http://www.evsc.net/v8/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/dipole_field02-300x228.gif) Any other object inside of a magnetic field will then feel a force on it because of its interaction with that field.  For physical magnets, like the kind you stick to your fridge, they get their magnetism by essentially being made up of a bunch of tiny magnets. The particles that make up atoms have a natural magnetic field due to a fundamental property they have, called \"spin\". This makes them like tiny magnets. If all these tiny magnets are pointing in random directions, they cancel each other out overall. On the other hand, if they arrange themselves to point in the same direction, the magnetic fields don't cancel out. Instead they add together and the whole object becomes a magnet.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why home blood tests do not exist, while we can measure our sugar levels with personal devices at home?",
    "answer": "The answer is: we're still trying to get there!  Sugar is easy to find for a few reasons.  1. Sugar is a small molecule who's shape is pretty consistent. This lets us design very effective receptors to interact with it in all environments (temp pH and salt content) The above isn't true for say proteins who's configurations are dependent on their local environment. Thus anything that interacts with them must do so under very controlled conditions. This might require either very specific environmental controls, or tedious preprocessing (preparation steps before measurement)  2. Sugar is relatively abundant to other species in your blood. Sugar exists on the order of magnitude of mmol/L in your blood. This is hundreds to hundreds of thousands of times higher than other relevant biomarkers. This is the difference of trying to measure the weight of a sandwich and the weight of the salt in the meat of the sandwich. The problems simply are not comparable. We also need more blood to be confident we will find something. 3. Diabetes is a massive market that provides financial incentive that has hugely oversaturated the sugar diagnostics market. If you're making a portable sensor, chances are that in the early stages, you're going to need a well known test case to compare your results to. Sugar measurement is a simple initial test. It's low hanging fruit for the reasons listed above. There are tons of comparison points. It's financially viable. Even if your goal is to diagnose cancer, at some point you will likely end up diagnosing sugar concentration.  There's no reason we can't make portable diagnostic devices that can measure protein and DNA concentrations, but it is simply harder to do than it is to measure sugar concentrations. We will get there one day.  tl;dr  Diagnostics is hard. Sugar is diagnostics on easy mode",

If you had an AC unit which could reverse directions, then it could indeed warm your home, and more efficiently than a regular furnace system. These are marketed and sold as \"heat pumps\".",
    "follow-up": "> These are marketed and sold as \"heat pumps\".  Yeah, air conditioners are just heat pumps with a cold end (the evaporator coils attached to your home\u2019s duct work) and a hot end (the big condenser box that sits outside).  The cold end absorbs heat from inside where it is the \u2018pumped\u2019 to the hot end where it then is released outside into the environment.  Technically you could just switch it up.  Put the hot condenser box *inside* the house and put the cold evaporator coils outside in the winter air.  ~~It just isn\u2019t efficient to heat an entire house this way.  Why would you look *outside* for heat in the winter?  It\u2019s like gathering around the hot coils on the back of the freezer to stay warm in the winter.

    "answer": "Rail cargo transport is used a lot more then you may think it is. The problem with rail is that it is costly to reload cargo. So it is often cheaper to load the cargo onto trucks so they can deliver the cargo all the way to the final destination rather then load it onto a train and carry it most of the way before having to reload it onto trucks for the last mile. Even the factories which have side tracks from the days of cheaper labor no longer use these as reloading the cargo onto a one or two car train for final delivery still costs too much.  However when enough cargo to fill a train is to be sent from one place to another then freight trains are still undisputed. Other places do have cargo collected in order to be sent on a freight train for longer distances as the reloading cost is lower then the cost of long distance trucks. A place like a big dock would be typical places where you could reload cargo between trucks, trains and ships. But the Netherlands is not big so most cargo within the country is likely going on trucks and then you have a few big cargo terminals mostly for international goods.",

    "answer": "Paint goes on in many layers.  There's often a primer, then sometimes multiple layers of paint, some of which can have metal flake.  Then a layer of clear-coat is sprayed over all of it, and like varnish on a portrait the clear coat changes the look entirely.  So think of all the variables a touch-up artist gets to juggle.  Say it's a key scratch that goes down to the metal.  You have to match the paint color, which if you're lucky is still factory and comes in a little tube but if not you do it by hand.  Then you have to mix or shake it to get the flakes suspended.  Then you have to apply it with the world's tiniest brush--the applicator in the paint tube is useless for a finesse job.  Then you have to try to sand it flat.    Then you have to try to get a clear-coat over it, and make *that* flat.  All without damaging the area around the scratch, or at least damaging it in such a way that it blends in.  I have shown some small sparks of talent from time to time as an artist, but touching up scratches on cars was surely one of the most difficult arts I ever practiced.

    "answer": "That is not always how it works. Some people regularly lucid dream, and quite often that starts with the conscious recognition that something in the dream doesn't make sense logically.  But once any part of you is consciously aware of the fact that you are sleeping, it becomes much more difficult to remain asleep. At that point any aggressive change in the status quo of the dream is likely to jar you awake.  So essentially the reason why you don't normally recognize after things as absurd in your dreams is because doing so would push you closer to waking up, and most people haven't really developed the skill or talent necessary to walk that razor edge of lucidity.",

Selecting the right oil for your car will impact your fuel efficiency - it might only be a 1% efficiency gain but over the lifetime of your car that can add up. Also the right oil will protect your engine and potentially add years to an engine's life.  Synthetic is normally a thinner oil and most new cars run comfortably on synthetic - the only real exception is Japanese cars - most Toyotas etc. have pretty much idiot proof engines and are happy running semi-synthetics.   Older cars - I'm talking older than 20 years - can exhibit problems when running on synthetics because the older engines can be pretty leaky and the thinner synthetic oil leaks out quicker.  But oils can be mixed - it's not a problem especially if it's only a top up - it's far more important that you don't over fill or under fill your engine oil. You must also check the engine oil level when then engine is warmed up already - if you're checking it cold you are not getting an accurate level.  It's important that you stick to your service recommendation for oil change because although your oil level might be correct and the oil may not be dirty there are additives in the oil which do get depleted.",

Due to large overhead costs (equipment, land, etc) being present in farming even at low volumes, but being relatively stable as production grows, that overhead cost shrinks when calculating cost per unit as production increases.   Let's say you have a $100k tractor to plant corn. If you plant 1000 stalks of corn, the cost of that tractor is allocated as $100k/1000 units, or $100/unit. If you plant 1 million stalks, your cost per unit shrinks to $0.10/unit in terms of operating that tractor, presuming you have the land to do it already and all else stays equal with the tractor.   Mass production farms capitalize on this significantly,  but building these economies of scale takes time and investment.

A grow light (Metal hylide or hi pressure sodium) is burning a chamber of sodium or another element that reacts to being charged and casts radiation and \"full spectrum\" light which just means its not focused on a single light frequency to save energy.. Its pusing multiple light frequencies from far red to UV, this better emulates natural light and has increased PPFD.  A light chart will show this as peaks and valley in the color spectum and the sudden spikes in the IR/ high red or UV/ high blues..

    "answer": "The idea of an RSA Token, or any other kind of Rotating Number One Time Password, is that you start at some initial value at some initial time. If both the token and the application that want authorization do the same calculations using that same initial condition, then at any time in the future, they can get the same answer and compare it. This means they know that they were the ones that synced earlier.  If the timekeeping on either device is out of sync, then when you say that the code right now should be \"ABCXYZ\", the other end might think \"No, right now it's supposed to be 'QWERTY'\". Being out of sync means that the trust is gone.  Depending on the system, you put some tolerances in it (i.e., you allow the token to be from N-1 to N+1 iterations out of sync), but that's mostly for user experience purposes. If you're truly getting out of sync, then odds are you will eventually hit N-2 or N+2 and be completely out of sync.  As for how, it depends on the system. If it's something like a Google Authenticator One Time Password system, if the time is *currently* incorrect on either device, then they won't get the right answer. With something like an actual RSA keyfob, those have their own clocks in them. If that clock is ever inaccurate, then it can gain or lose time.

    "question": "ELI5: Why is a second resistor needed here for the discharge path?",
    "answer": "Disclaimer: I am not a professional electronics engineer.   But from what I understand, both resistors are not strictly necessary.    The 555 can both source and sink current on its output, so a discharge resitors to ground is not necessary.    The mosfets gate doesn't allow current to flow, so the current limiting resistor is not really needed either.    But: they are there to protect components in case of failure.    If the mosfet fails and forms a short circuit from gate to ground you now have a short circuit between the 555 output and ground.  \u200b This means if the mosfet blows, it will take the 555 with it. The resistor between the mosfet and 555 limits the current in this scenario, protecting the 555.        If the 555 fails and the output is disconnected, the gate pin of the mosfet is now \"floating\". That means it is not referenced to ground or +5V anymore.   This is a problem because static electricity will build up a charge on the gate, but we can't make any predictions on what that charge will actually be in reference to the rest of our circuit.   A floating gate results in problems like the mosfet opening and closing randomly or opening just a bit and overheating because of the high resistance of half-open mosfets. (Almost burned my finger this way once)  The resistor between ground and the gate acts as a permanent path to ground, allowing any static charge to dissipate. This is usually refered to as a \"pull-down resistor\", since it \"pulls\" the pin \"down\" to ground.   The actual value of the resistor is not that critical. It needs to be high enough so that the ouput of the 555 can create enough voltage to drive the mosfet gate and so that not enough current flows through the pull-down to destroy the 555 (that's why a simple wire to ground would not work).",

    "question": "ELI5: Why did people on the Oregon Trail not plan to stop sooner?",
    "answer": "At the time the Oregon trail was popular it was made popular by mountain men and fur traders so there was an established economy and hope of \u201cwealth\u201d in the far west of the United states. Most of those were by foot and horse back. Later just before the gold rush the first few wagon trains left from Missouri. And later Nebraska. So most folks were already stopping earlier anyways. Later once the gold rush had boomed the \u201cOregon trail\u201d had become the more established and  was the more widely used passage over the Rockies And the Sierra Nevada mountains. Travelers then went south from \u201cOregon\u201d into California.(when the turned south it really wasn\u2019t in Oregon for most travelers) And by the time the gold rush happened and the chase for the gold and ultimate wealth happened no one was stopping anywhere until they got to California. In the early days of the Oregon trail most of the fur trappers and mountain men went north into the heart of the Oregon territory and what became modern day Washington.   But the gold rush period and the results of it,  is what made popular what most people think of the Oregon trail.   Little known facts. HWY 80 going west, and then most of the highways in the west were a result of the first and the most popular routes taken by the pioneers. With many spots of the trail being maintained by entrepreneurial land owners who make the trails nice and charge a small toll to use the path. Many people paid because it made the travel that much easier and faster. Eventually the sections of trail where so highly used, known about and maintained that they became roads and then US and state highways.   Also, once the gold rush happened other routes over the Sierra\u2019s where investigated and a new \u201csouthern\u201d route was found going through modern day Reno and over Donner Summit. Made popular by the Donner Party who became trapped by a great snow storm.  Most of the people in the Donner party died as a result of the snow and were then eaten by other members of their party to survive.  (I have some stories about why the Donner party was caught in the mountains so late in the year as well, but thats for another post)   Also, The section of Trail just before the mountain pass ,(roughly between Elko Nevada and Reno) dubbed the 40 mile desert because it was roughly 40 miles long became the most deadly section of the entire trail from the east coast to California. Due to its high amount of predator animals, lack of game animals, high swings in temperatures and weather as well as lack of good water sources killed more people in that stretch than anywhere else on the westward pioneer trail.   History lesson aside, the long and short of it, as I\u2019ve been told and have studied is that most people where so driven on either greed or promises and stories of a better life that they were hell bent on getting to the \u201cpromised land\u201d of the west coast. Some made it. Many died trying and Im assuming many more just gave up along the way.",

As noted before, the medical profession has a lot of inertia (like lots of professions), and the sense of \u201cI did it this way, so my successors should also do it this way\u201d is high.   There\u2019s also the notion of \u201ctraining like you practice.\u201d The idea there is to teach residents to practice on very little sleep with the intent of making basic medical decisions become second nature. For example, if you\u2019re on call and someone comes in with chest pain, you should be able to, almost literally, triage that \u201cin your sleep.\u201d   In larger hospital systems (where the majority of physicians train), there are supposed to be redundancies which minimize the fallout from mistakes made by overtired staff. Idk if it\u2019s still the norm, but during my training, residents were usually more worried about being told off by an attending physician than they were about making a rudimentary mistake that could affect patient safety. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t care, they just trusted the systems in place to protect from that sort of slip-up.   However, putting my lawyer hat on, some residents and their associated training programs have been held accountable for mistakes that could be attributed to lack of sleep (I\u2019ve got these saved somewhere and would be happy to provide cases upon request). Their training programs and associated hospitals were also implicated, and I would hope going forward, these outcomes are taken into consideration in the broader medical training community.   Long story short, there\u2019s a balancing act between \u201cthe way it\u2019s always been done,\u201d the relative lack of practitioners, new information about the way people learn/practice, and what\u2019s best for the patient.

We take call for 7 days in a row, Monday 8am to Monday 8am. Some weeks you are semi-human and sleep at least 4-5 hours per night and things are good...others you average 2-3 per night or less...then Monday comes around and you have a regular work day after those 7 days in a row.  I cannot adequately describe to you how wonderful the sleep is on that second Monday night.  It is great to talk about in theory...but when you are the one who is sick, what would you want us to do? \u201cI am so sorry that you are so sick that you may die...but I\u2019m really tired and I am the only physician assigned to you...so I am going to take a nap and I\u2019ll be back with you in a few hours after I feel better, assuming you are still here.\u201d  Vs.  \u201cYes I will help you regardless of whether I have slept so little that my EEG looks like a drunk person.\u201d  From a paper by Steven Howard MD at Baylor College of Medicine looking at sleep deprivation: -Health care workers need to begin to think of coming to work impaired by chronic sleep deprivation as similar to coming to work impaired by alcohol. Studies reveal that as ethanol and sleep loss increase, psychomotor performance decreases and memory is impaired. A 2-hour sleep loss is equivalent to a 0.045% breath-alcohol concentration, and a 4-hour sleep loss is equivalent to a 0.095% breath-alcohol concentration (3)\u2014above Texas' legal limit of 0.08%.-  But again...if you are the sick person, do you really want us to just go to sleep and wish you the best of luck?   It is the system as it stands now that you work until the work is done. Hopefully over time this will change. I love what I do. I will not let a child seize endlessly because, poor little me, I am too sleepy. I will suck it up and do the best I can. However, as per many comments here that I agree with, there are better ways to do it, and I hope as time goes on we change the system based on objective data, rather than just keep on saying \u201cthis is just the way it is.\u201d",

    "answer": "Disclaimer: I have only been trained to do animal autopsies, things may be different for humans.   When you do an autopsy, you examine each body system systemically. Some causes of death may be obvious (eg trauma, blood clots, clear abnormalities in the organs), others may be more subtle (eg poisoning). To get a definitive answer, a pathologist will sample each organ they are suspicious of and have them preserved and inspected microscopically for changes in the cell structures, which can indicated cause of death as well. They will also commonly sample them for culture and PCR of bacteria/viruses. In humans, they may also run blood toxicology prior to starting the autopsy.  As for time of death, that is based on decomposition. Eg: rigor Mortis starts an hour after death, but resolved after 18 hours (if I remember correctly), the corneas cloud over after 12 hours, ect.",

Once everyone arrives, birds that form long-term relationships use sight and sound to recognize each other and get reacquainted.

    "question": "Eli5: Can someone explain what a T cell(s?) are? Can someone also explain what a B cell is? Are one of these antibodies?",
    "answer": "T cells and B cells are both types of white blood cells, or lymphocytes.  Antibodies, on the other hand, are molecules which specifically interact with pathogens/\u201cbad\u201dmolecules in the body. Different T cells have different duties, but generally they are responsible for recognizing the presence of pathogens (with the help of other immune cells, like macrophages which first kill any non-\u201cyou\u201d cells, like foreign bacteria). Once a T cell recognizes a pathogen, it can signal the rest of the immune system to get the body ready to fight the pathogen. Other types of T cells then go through the body and destroy any of your own cells that have been infected.  Another part of the response is the production of B cells. Each B cell is created to fight the specific pathogen by producing antibodies which will only recognize that pathogen. The antibodies go through the body and attach to any of the pathogen they find, which lets them be quickly recognized and broken down by other immune cells.  Other B cells (memory B cells) are responsible for staying in the immune system \u201cheadquarters\u201d and keeping a record of the pathogen so that if you get infected again even years later, the correct antibodies can be produced much much quicker. This is the core principle of immunization, you intentionally create memory B cells in a way that doesn\u2019t infect you so that if you actually get infected, your immune system is ready to fight it off.",
    "follow-up": "Let me see if I got this straight. There are two kinds of T cells. The 1st T cell recognizes that a virus is taking hold, which makes another cell to make antibodies. Antibodies are not cells. Clarification do antibodies kill stuff on their own? From there different T cells respond along with some other cells(?) to fight the infection. Are Antibodies themselves fighting anything or are they more just like painting their target so its easy to spot?",

They're different names, with adrenaline used more in European medicine and epinephrine used more in US medicine.  They do pretty similar things. But norepinephrine is more of a constant, while epinephrine comes more in bursts during stress. Norepinephrine constricts blood vessels, keeping your blood pressure up.

People knew the Earth was round and had a pretty good idea just how bit it was, it was estimated pretty accurately in Ancient Greek times, and they knew Columbus' idea of how far it would be to China was ludicrously short, meaning the amount of food and water he could pack into his ships would run out a fraction of the way there, and then everyone would starve.

    "answer": "A modern nuclear weapon is usually a fission-fusion-fission design. That means you use a fission reaction to get enough energy for a fusion reaction and then use the neutrons from the fusion to get even more fission. That can give you a really *tremendous* kaboom in a smallish package.  For a neutron bomb (aka an Enhanced Radiation Weapon) you skip the last fission stage. Instead of absorbing those neutrons and using them to make more kaboom you let them go screaming off into the world to fuck shit up.  The benefit this gets you is that you get a relatively small (for a nuke) blast, with a relatively big deadly radiation distance. This is useful if the thing you are trying to kill is heavily resistant to blast effect (like a tank) or very hard to hit (like an incoming nuclear warhead).  In practice the only actual deployment of neutron weapons was as anti-ballistic missile systems, because that's where they really shine.",

    "answer": "Insects are a huge family of life and have many different adaptations. I can only speak with any authority on honey bees.  Honey bee bodies are adapted to work most efficiently at about 35C/95F, and they can generate some heat internally just like humans. Unlike humans, who will die if their internal temperature changes by more than about 5C, honey bees can survive internal temperature changes of 30C. When they're very cold, they become slow and sluggish, and when they're very warm they become quite fast and agitated. This is simply the effects of chemistry, cold temperatures slow down their internal chemistry and warm temperatures speed it up. Too cold and they freeze, to hot and they expend all their energy and die of starvation very quickly.  Honey bees have behavioural adaptations to deal with hot and cold. When it's cold, they will shiver to warm up and if there's several bees together than can form a group and shiver together to keep the whole group warm. When it's hot, they will fan air through the hive and fan each other to cool down. A hot bee will also seek shade and water to drink. Though they don't sweat, they do lose moisture in their breath and that can help to cool them too, which is very similar to how dogs cool themselves with \"panting\".",

    "answer": "The company doesn\u2019t directly make money from post-IPO trading. The *employees* often do because stock, stock options, and stock grants are a frequent part of executive compensation.   In addition, many companies will issue more stock later if they need to raise more money. You can only do that with a healthy stock, so maintaining a good stock price is necessary to ever raising money that way again.   Stock buybacks are a way of repaying investors, like a dividend but without some of the baggage. What changes does the company is the stock price goes up/stays up (more) and they lose a bunch of cash. They can issue more shares later, and investors are more likely to buy them at a good price if they know the company has the cash flow to support stock buybacks.   Keep in mind that, almost always, the people making these kinds of decision (board members, high level executives) are also shareholders.

Compression works by removing details and finding patterns across multiple pixels so taking a high bitrate 4k video and resizing it to 1080p won't loose as much quality as you might expect.  Interestingly the relationship between bitrate and resolution isn't super straightforward. A high resolution video can look either better or worse than a lower resolution video at the same bitrate.   Basically the larger resolutions have more potential to show detail, but if you don't include enough detail then having more pixels makes it easier to notice the poor quality  Check here for a chart: https://teradek.com/blogs/articles/what-is-the-optimal-bitrate-for-your-resolution",

    "answer": "Most \"strong\" glass materials you think of are tempered, some quite extremely  When tempering glass, you take the heated semi molten glass and cool it rapidly, this causes the outside to rapidly crystalize rapidly while the inside cools and tries to pull away storing a lot of energy in both the surface and core of the glass.  Now the crystals on the outside are very tightly bound to each other so if you want to crack/chip the glass you have to overcome this pent up energy first, but once you do the rest of the energy tends to release and the cracks quickly spread through the tempered glass.  This is why safety glass in car windows (highly tempered) tends to explode as soon as it gets cracked, its all of the energy suddenly releasing.  Gorilla glass is chemically tempered to store up the energy.  The smaller sodium ions in the sodium glass get replaced by bigger potassium ions which pushes against all the nearby sodium ions storing up compressive stress in the face of the glass similar to tempering  Some devices who want absurd scratch resistance have started using sapphire glass which is an aluminum oxide (Al2O3) in thin sheets.

The benefit of whole life insurance is that you will eventually collect, as you must eventually die, but the main drawback is that it is much more expensive, because it represents a greater liability to the insurance company, who has to set the rate such that the odds are that you pay more into it than you will get out of it (otherwise they lose money). Whole life insurance does not make good financial sense for that exact reason, it is basically a savings account, and not a good one.  Term life insurance is cheaper, since, if you outlive your coverage, the insurance company doesn't have to pay out, and as such they can hedge their policies to make sure they come out ahead. Term life insurance is important if you are the main source of income for your family, have substantial debt, or otherwise need to make sure people are taken care of in the case of your death.

    "answer": "A seed box is a dedicated device for torrenting. These are typically VM's on a managed server.  There are a few reasons to use a seedbox, but in general...  1. They hide your identity when torrenting. Normally, anyone else accessing the same torrent can get your IP, and that can lead to a chain of events with you being charged for distributing illegal goods.  2. They have dedicated connections with strong upload speeds. This means that you can download stuff quickly, as well as upload. This helps maintain your ratio (how much you upload for how much you download) which is needed for many private torrent sites.  3. You can download torrents immediately, and then download the files within them at your leisure. This is useful for setting up automated downloads. You download things immediately when they become available, and later grab the file when you want it.  Beyond that, there are some seedbox services where users actually keep the raw files on the seedbox and stream their content off of them as they please. You might setup a Plex server on the seedbox that you then stream the stuff you have downloaded off of and on your personal device. You never have to download a local copy of the file, so there's nothing to manage at home aside from your streaming app.",

    "answer": "GPUs now are a bit like \"programmable CPUs\", or ASICs.   Basically, you can program them to do functions in hardware. Some very specific functions are used for mining cryptos, usually one specific algorithm per crypto family ( i say family because nearly every bitcoin derived cryptos use the same algorithm). Mostly, GPUs are used to mine ethereum, because that is the crypto that earns the most. It will also stop being that much profitable in july, with some modifications to the transaction system, and it is supposed to go \"proof of stake\", meaning it cannot be mined anymore, by the end of the year.  &#x200B;  That being said, nvidia's new GPU lock means it will recognise the algorithm used to mine ethereum, and perform lower when found. The algorithm is very unlikely to ever be used for gaming or video editing.  Note: unlike the previous \"soft lock\" , that was a kind of an added identifier chip on the board that the driver would read, then cut performance or not, the new one is supposedly a \"hardware lock\", meaning the locking part is IN the GPU and cannot be bypassed.  &#x200B;  Now, the reason nvidia does that is simply to shift the blame from them to a convenient scapegoat.  Nvidia cannot face the demand for its 30x0 chips, due to originally not making enough, then being struck by the global chip shortage, and that is not going to be better soon.  Just like every product in huge demand and low supply, it gets scalped to oblivion. AMD's card suffer from the same, although their architecture prevents them from being used for mining.  But popular opinion claims this is caused - and keeps going on- because miners buy them all.   Now, miners usually do it for the money, which means they are predictable. upon a very simple return on investment computation, and a risk vs reward analysis. And, most of all, they use the cards, they do not sell them. Meaning if you can get cards, even at scalping price, it means miners do not get them.  The question is then \"are cards available at scalper prices ?\" and since the answer is \"yes\", it means miners are not a concern. They may have been by the end of last year/start of this one, but it became very risky financially wise to start eth mining past february/march. It did hit an all time high not that long ago... and lost more than 70% of its value in a couple of days, last week.  In the end what most people do now when they buy a 3070 or 3080 is to use them to play / work, and mine when they do not, because it went from highly technical to as simple as making some double clicks. Just ... dont expect making much doing that.  anyway.  Since popular opinion says miners are the cause, and not nvidia for not making sufficient chips, nvidia claims they are doing something to address that issue.  This gives them a few months of tranquility. And then they will probably say miners bypassed their protection as a reason for the scalping to continue.",

    "question": "ELI5: How is electricity physically measured (like at the meter on my house)?",
    "answer": "Maybe not ELI5, but here you go.  Electricity is the flow of electrons.   Electrons flow because they are pushed by a *voltage*. The voltage is like the pressure causes water to flow in a pipe.  The amount of electrons that flow is termed the *current*. The current is like the flowrate of water in the pipe.  More voltage (pressure) = more current (flow).  So if you want to talk about flow, you might say there are 10 electrons travelling past a point every second (electrons per second), just like how you might talk about water flow in litres or gallons per second.  If you want to find the total volume of water, you take the flow and multiply it by time. So if you had 10 litres per second, after 100 seconds you used 10\u00d7100=1000 litres.  Same for electricity. You take the amperage, and multiply it by time. We could do electrons per second, but we use Amperes to measure current. We also use hours instead of seconds.  So what do you get when you multiply Amperes and Hours? Ampere-hour (Ah), which is what you see on your electricity bill. The ampere-hour is the amount of electricity you used.  Now we know how you measure time, but what about current?  Inside your meter is a *current transformer*. This consists of a metal donut that surrounds the main conductor going into your house. A copper wire is coiled around the donut.  The electricity going through the main conductor is AC (*alternating current*). Now when electricity flows, it creates a magnetic field. When that current *alternates*, so does the magnetic field. So you have an *alternating magnetic field* surrounding the main conductor. This fluctuating magnetic field causes magnetic field lines to pass through that copper coil in your little current transformer, and that *induces* a small current in the copper coil.  This copper coil is connected to a smarter device which includes an ammeter which measures the current. This is then used to calculate the current in the main conductor.  The current \u00d7 time calculation is done at small intervals and added together to account for varying loads.",

If we evolved with more or less pressure, we would notice the difference on earth. Think of it like diving deep in a pool or lake; the deeper you go, the more it hurts because of the pressure. On the contrary, look at the blobfish. They\u2019re so \u201cblobby\u201d because we see them in lower pressure environments than they\u2019re used to.

    "question": "ELI5; Why does too much caffeine cause jitters and a hard crash? Why do some caffeine sources not cause a crash compared to coffee?",
    "answer": "Caffeine's main effect is on the brain. It functions by blocking the effects of adenosine, which is a neurotransmitter that relaxes the brain and makes you feel tired. Normally, adenosine levels build up over the day, making you increasingly more tired and causing you to want to go to sleep. The structure of the caffeine molecule found in one source (say, tea or coffee) should be exactly identical to that found in other sources. The body reacts to overall levels of caffeine, and hence the pharmacodynamic response is different depending on how much is consumed per unit time.",
    "follow-up": "Is it possible that differing sources of caffeine have not only different amounts, but also different entourages of flavinoid chemicals that affect the overall effect?  E.g. tea contains tannins as well as a lower caffeine content per volume (typically) than coffee, which does not contain tannins.  Do you think the tannin content might play a part in the different effects felt from consuming tea vs coffee?  Edit: coffee may have *some* tannins, but not nearly as much as tea.",

    "question": "ELI5: How does Netflix Make money on it's original series like \"Squid Game?\"",
    "answer": "The way Netflix works is that it makes you sign up for the service, and then tries to prevent you cancelling your subscription. 900 million dollars is what Netflix estimates they'll bring in from the combination of people who subscribed to the service because of squid game, and people who will continue their subscription after squid game where they otherwise might have chosen to cancel it.   Netflix's whole thing is that it makes just enough good content for you to think you should keep your subscription going. It measures the effectiveness of content in terms of watch time - how much time the userbase as a whole spends watching a show. It takes that number and compares it to the cost of making the show, the total time users spend watching *all* content on Netflix, and the subscription fees people pay to figure out an estimate of how much money the show makes for them. This is basically a number of how much money they think they  *wouldn't* have made if they *hadn't* made Squid Game, from people cancelling their subscriptions or just not signing up in the first place.",
    "follow-up": "Exactly. It\u2019s a *but-for* calculation. \u201cBut-for *Squid Game*, what would Netflix revenues have been?\u201d  For a big show premiere, you can use an event study to estimate effects on viewership and new customers, and then extrapolate the trends (using data from past premieres) to estimate the total effect. Basically, how much did viewership/sign-ups jump, and how long will these effect be expected to last?   Estimating this for smaller shows is probably a lot more difficult, because each show cannibalizes viewership for other shows and these shows probably don\u2019t do much for new sign-ups but help more with retention of existing customers.",

    "question": "ELI5 what is rollback in fighting games and how come it makes it feel like there isn\u2019t really any lag?",
    "answer": "There are two ways you can write up the netcode for a game. You can either handle the button presses when they were originally pressed, or you can handle them when they get to the central server.  Let's say you're starting with the central server timing. This is also referred to as Delay-Based. If you press a button on your screen, until you receive an acknowledgement from the server that the button was pressed, nothing happens. This creates a lag that you have to overcome that just isn't present with in-person gaming, and is going to vary greatly depending on your connection at the time. However, everything you see on your screen is guaranteed to be what actually happens.  The other way, handling buttons based on when they were originally pushed, is what is referred to as rollback.  Imagine each button press gets sent to the server with a timestamp. Your local game can start playing the actions right away, because it expects that the server will accept that button press at that time.  When it gets to the server, it will look at the timestamp of the button press. If it has already done any calculations for any button presses later than that, then it rolls back those button presses, adds the new one, and then replays them, and sends the correction to both clients.  This means that you effectively always get your button press at the time you pressed it, without weird lag making it much later than you intended. This also means that, if there is substantial lag, you can see the game stutter as it corrects itself, but if there is very little lag, then everything appears very smooth for both players, making them feel as if it's a local game.",

    "answer": "The gas giant planets are incredibly hot inside.  They have an enormous, rocky core, the surface of which is closer to a volcano than the earth's crust.  It's covered with an ocean of liquid gas that consantly boiling away then raining down again. Anything that falls to the surface is boiled and returns to the upper atmosphere.  The problem with the diamond rain is that it's theoretical. The presence of it depends on how convective the lower atmosphere and oceans are.  If they're highly convective then the diamonds will mix with oxygen and burn to create Co2. Eventually, all the carbon will be burned this way and there'll be no diamond rain.  If they're more evenly layered, or if a thick layer of hot gas is preventing the liquid ocean from coming into contact with the molten surface, then the diamonds will fall into the lava and boil away without getting the chance to bond with any oxygen.  AFAIK, we don't know which of these is true. We don't even know how thick the atmospheres are or how big or hot the rocky cores are.",

    "answer": ">So what the heck is the other ingredient causing hangover, and why does nobody talk about it?  There's some biochemistry to be known here. Whenever you ingest something by mouth, the first place it goes after the intestines is the liver, the major center for *metabolism*, or breaking down of chemicals, in the body.  The body wants things to be as simple as possible so they can be flushed out. In the liver, alcohol, or more precisely *ethanol* is attacked by the enzyme *alcohol dehydrogenase* -- \"alcohol,\" referring to the type of chemical it attacks, \"dehydrogen-\" for what it does (literally pulling a hydrogen away from something), and the \"-ase\" ending denoting an enzyme.  So ethanol binds to the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, which pulls off the hydrogen at the end of the molecule, converting it into something called *acetaldehyde*, which is then kicked into the body and allowed to circulate.  It's that chemical, acetaldehyde, which is the other contributing cause of hangover. The body processes acetaldehyde in a similar way, over time, splitting it again into something the body can eliminate.",

Point of fact: we HAVE cured some cancers. Other cancers have treatments with various degrees of success.   What makes it difficult? There\u2019s a different type of cancer for each type of cell in the body mate! There are **hundreds** of different cancers! It takes years to isolate and test and formulate each treatment for each different cancer. Sometimes they get one that sort of works and move on to the next. Sometimes they cure it. Sometimes they spend lifetimes failing to grasp the nuance.    Curing a disease isn\u2019t like some magic-wand bop on the head and you\u2019re fixed! Doctors have to isolate the problem from multiple dying people who probably don\u2019t want to be experimented on. Then they have to learn what makes that problem work.

    "follow-up": ">THEN they have to test it on    >   >more   >   > dying people who still don\u2019t want to be experimented on.  to clarify - not exactly \"on dying people\". Clinical testing is done on various groups. The problem is elsewhere - no matter the patient's condition, they might be not available because of consent reasons, or legal reasons in their country/their particular situation.  &#x200B;  Or their consent might get revoked half way through the test duration. Either by them, or the testing itself might get scrubbed for some reason.  &#x200B;  Even if the drug passes the test re: it works against the disease - questions remain. Are side effects acceptable, for example? Are the risk levels of them not too excessive? A new great antibiotic is not exactly useful if it has 25% or 50% chance of killling the patient (number is an example, obviously, but you get the idea). Are there legal reasons due to which this chemical/drug cannot be used (i.e. patents by 3rd party?).     Then there's the issue of statistics. Usually clinical testing takes years to decades, and its a rare occurence that its fast tracked (like the COVID vaccines were, for example, due to extreme need for them) in any way. Why it takes so long? Long-term effects is one cause, but the second cause is also the fact that you need a statistical sample for accurate picture of any effects / side effects. Which can be ...problematic if you have ten or twenty cases of some  rare cancer annually, worldwide.   &#x200B;  Of which half might not be available for testing, and half of what remains does not consent to being part of testing process.

    "answer": "Atoms have a core of \"hadrons\", specifically two types of hadrons called Protons and Neutrons. Around this core they also have orbiting \"Electrons\".  All atoms are made of different numbers of these things. Protons, Neutrons and Electrons.   Ah, but Lemming, I hear you say, what are THOSE made of then?   Well, Hadrons are made of Quarks, and both Quarks and Electrons are made when high energy Photons collide, so basically everything is made of Light, when you get right down to it.",
    "follow-up": "That's only true as an interesting symbolic statement right? Correct me if I'm wrong, but they're not made OF light. They're a byproduct, but light is also a byproduct of the interaction of particles. There is transferability between different kinds of matter and energy, but that transferability doesn't mean they're made of each other. Just like I can transfer my US dollar to British Pounds, but the British pound doesn't make up the US dollar.",

    "question": "ELI5: If the body raises its temperature to kill bacteria, why is it bad to take a hot shower when you have a fever?",
    "answer": "It\u2019s not bad to take a hot shower during a fever, it\u2019s just uncomfortable. At the same time, taking a cold shower is not recommended because as your skin (periphery) cools down due to cold water, the body tries to compensate by increasing your core (inside) temperature which we don\u2019t want in a patient already suffering from fever. Hence lukewarm water is the best for this situation.  Now there are chemical compounds called pyrogens (molecules that cause fever). Usually the process goes like this : bacteria/virus/microorganisms enter our body, body/immune system detects certain proteins and chemical structures on them (like the cell wall,etc), sends a signal to the brain, brain is like oops need to kill that, need more ammo, so they release some other substances/chemical compounds which further activates the immune system.  Now both the microorganisms and the brain/immune system\u2019s compounds are what we call pyrogens.  So exogenous ( from outside) pyrogens like bacteria give rise to endogenous (from inside the body) pyrogens like the immune system cells which increases the body temperature level just the way you adjust the thermostat to a higher setting.  Hope this helps. Feel free to ask any questions :)  Edit : Thanks for all the upvotes and awards, science is great, I love it  Edit : adding this signalling pathway for people who are interested  so bacteria inside the body \u2014 bacterial cell wall has certain proteins on it \u2014\u2014 immune cells (mainly macrophages, first line of defence) detect those proteins \u2014\u2014 immune cells go to the protein (hence the bacteria) binds to it \u2014\u2014 this binding results in a release of bunch of other chemicals (interleukins) \u2014- release of these chemicals activates an enzyme (enzymes are proteins that make chemical reactions happen/happen faster) \u2014- this enzyme releases something called PGE2 ( a prostaglandin) \u2014\u2014- this PGE2 acts like a hormone \u2014- go to the nerve cells in hypothalamus part of the brain\u2014\u2014 hypothalamus detects this PGE2 and understands that temp of the body must be raised \u2014- so it tells the muscles to produce more heat, diverts blood from periphery to the core and breaks down some fat cells as they produce heat  Edit : omg this blew up, I love being able to share all this with you guys, sorry for late replies, I was at work",

    "question": "ELI5: If the body raises its temperature to kill bacteria, why is it bad to take a hot shower when you have a fever?",
    "answer": "Doctor here  It's about expending energy. Your body is using up lots of energy to fight the infection. Any extreme temperatures both hot and cold from the outside will cause your body to expend energy trying to fight against this change in temperature as if tries to reach an equilibrium.  This means being cold or being too hot is wasting your body's energy which it could be using to fight the infection.  It's very much different from the internal thermostat which tells your body to increase its temperature SLIGHTLY to create a fever which kills the infection but hopefully has your enzymes still working well and good. This is also why it's recommended to only take fever lowering medication if your body temperature goes over 38,5C. Over 38,5C starts bring detrimental to normal bodily functions. 37 to 38,5C is usually the sweet spot.  In addition, getting yourself wet usually leads to some cooling through evaporation which again, causes your body to use precious energy reserves to heat you back up again.  Being under a blanket is different in this regard. It's not sudden extreme temperature. Just a way for your body to not feel subjectively cold due to the difference between your body temperature and outside temperature. And if actually saves your body energy resources.  Just as not moving and staying in bed and sleeping works wonders for getting healthy too because it saves energy. Also eating soup or other easily digestible things is a good idea. Why? Because digestion is an energy intensive process when you have to digest meat and veggies and fruit.   Why do people get drowsy when they fall ill? It's their body telling them to stay in one place, conserve energy and slow the bleep down.",

    "question": "ELI5 : How are carcinogens created as a byproduct of burning organic matter?",
    "answer": "When you burn organic matter, that is, matter based primarily on carbon-containing molecules, all kinds of chemical reactions occur when bonds get broken and new bonds get formed. The carbon-containing compounds react with the oxygen in the air, and tend to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor as a result.  However, that reaction only fully proceeds to completion under ideal conditions. Under most real-world conditions, there is incomplete combustion, which means the carbon-containing molecules only get partially broken up. Sometimes they loop back on themselves to form a ring-like structure. Sometimes they attach to other similarly-shaped molecules in chains. There are all sorts of chemicals created during combustion, depending on what you started with and what conditions you\u2019re burning in. Some chemicals are produced more often than others, no matter what the conditions. And as it turns out, a lot of those chemicals can cause cancer.  I\u2019ve glossed over a few things so please let me know if you need me to clarify anything.",

    "question": "eli5 what does \u201celectromagnetic\u201d means in the context of light waves?",
    "answer": "*I may have got a bit carried away here, but I didn't have anything else to do this evening... well, nothing important.*  Electricity is about how things with charge push and pull each other around.  Magnetism is... a weird twisty thing that makes some metals stick to each other sometimes.  Electricity was known about over 4,000 years ago - or rather, they knew about effects of electricity; that certain fish could shock you, that lightning was a weird phenomena, that if you rubbed amber you could get things to stick to it. But without the scientific method or the tools to investigate it it was mostly just a curiosity.  There is evidence of people knowing about magnetism over 2,000 years ago; noticing that there were special rocks that iron would stick to.  Around 600 BCE the Greek philosopher and mathematician Thales of Miletus studied both static electric and magnetic effects, and thought they seemed similar - both involving stuff sticking to other things, but with the magnetic stone always working, and the amber material (used for static electricity) needing to be rubbed to make it stick.  By the 12th century travellers in China and later Europe started using magnetic materials to navigate by - the first magnetic compasses. And with that, studying magnetism became a bit more important. In 1600 an English scientist, William Gilbert published a book called De Magnete, in which he set out a bunch of experiments he'd done on magnetism and electricity, showing that they were separate things (and that Thales was wrong), that the Earth was a giant magnet, and he introduced the term electricus (from the Greek for \"like amber\") to describe what we now call electricity (a term that was first used nearly 50 years later).  The 17th and 19th centuries saw a big increase in research on this new \"electricity\" thing, with people like Benjamin Franklin carrying out all sorts of experiments to try to understand it, in 1800 Alessandro Volta developed a battery that could store electricity; electricity was all the rage - although not necessarily with that many practical uses.  In 1819 a Danish physicist, Hans Christian \u00d8rsted, noticed that if you moved a wire with current flowing in it near a compass, the compass needle twitched.  This was the breakthrough needed to finally start putting the pieces together on how electricity and magnetism worked. Over the next few years people like \u00d8rsted, Amp\u00e8re, Faraday, Ohm and Gauss made great progress in understanding how electricity and magnetism worked and were related, and in the 1860s James Clerk Maxwell put it all together to create a series of laws that showed Electricity and Magnetism to be different aspects of the same thing. Not electricity and magnetism, but electromagnetism. Magnetism could be seen as what happens when you view electric effects from a different perspective. Changing electric effects create magnetic effects, and changing magnetic effects produce electric effects.  But there were a couple of weird things that came out of Maxwell's Equations.  If you solved his equations in a vacuum (where there was no existing electric or magnetic effects), you got waves. Waves travelling at a very specific speed defined by existing electric and magnetic physical constants. This speed - when calculated - turned out to be the same as the speed of light. This was another major breakthrough; understanding that light was ripples in electric and magnetic fields - that it was created by wiggling things with charge. Wiggle the thing with charge and you get a changing electric effect. Now you have a changing electric effect you have a changing magnetic effect. But that changing magnetic effect creates a new changing electric effect and so on and so on... the interchanging electric and magnetic effects keep each other going, moving across space as a combined ripple. Light.  Except not just light. Light is only the part we can see. This stuff helped people understand that a bunch of other things they knew about - ultraviolet light, infra-red radiation, later radio waves, microwaves, x-rays... they were all the same thing, these electromagnetic waves, just with different frequencies of wiggle.  Of course there were still problems with the theories, and it would take people like Einstein to put together more pieces of the puzzle - uncovering Special Relativity and what we now call Quantum Mechanics. By the mid-20th century quantum mechanics was developed enough to fill in the last few bits.  ... so... erm... yes.  **tl;dr**: Electromagnetism is a physical interaction - a way stuff affects other stuff. It used to be electricity and magnetism, but it turns out electric and magnetic effects are just different ways of viewing the same thing.",

    "answer": "Your lippie is probably half assorted silicones, half dyes.   Isododecane is also used in hair spray. It goes on clean and minimizes transfer. Trimethylsiloxysilicate is a soft skin adhesive (kind of like other silicones used for healthcare applications). Dimethicone is a moisturizer (all three of these have moisturizing properties apparently). Cyclopentasiloxane, or D5, repels water. It's basically a soft, smooth sealant. Cyclotetrasiloxane, or D4, is a kissing cousin of D5. Trihydroxystearin is a castor oil derivative that basically thickens the mix and moisturizes your lips. Disteardimonium hectorite is a modified clay compound. I think it's being used as a dispersing agent to make sure everything in the mixture stays, well, mixed? Propylene carbonate is a solvent. You dissolve stuff in it. Tocopheryl acetate is just vitamin E. Phenoxyethanol is a preservative. Ethylhexylglycerin helps preservatives work and also helps protect your skin and keep everything mixed. The rest is dyes and minerals.  A lot of these are emollients (moisturizers) and solvents (things you dissolve other things in) as well as these properties. Because many of the top ingredients act as sort of sealants, whatever proprietary mixture they have will therefore end up working in conjunction together to... Well. Do what you want lipstick to do.

    "question": "ELI5: Why does my skin feel like I need to scratch it off anything I get too hot or I sweat??",
    "answer": "You mean KVL and KCL, in the context of electricity?  Kirchhoff's Current Law says that if you look at any part of the circuit, the amount of current going out equals the amount of current going in. Or in other words, current only flows in loops. It doesn't come from one place and go to another.   Kirchhoff's Voltage Law says that if you look at any loop, the total voltage is zero. Things like batteries add voltage and most other things remove voltage so that when you get to the battery again it's all gone. Even if you change the number of components in the loop, the voltages will adjust so they add up to zero again. You can also see this as: all the voltage from the battery is allocated to some component with none left over. (but pay attention that if you have more than one loop, it applies to each loop separately)",
    "follow-up": "So what your saying about KVL is that by the time you get back to battery the voltage equals 0? Why does that happen, what if all you had was a resistor, surely the doesn\u2019t mean that it will drop all those volts.",

The total amount of memory is correctly just shy of 70kb of memory but spread around 6 computers, 2 identical for of 3 types.     The problem is that is it not stored on 8 track tape but plated wire memory.     The Computer Command System (CCS) was used in a no redundant way to have 9.2 Kbytes watch. The information store here could and was updated during flight so all required software for the flight was on it at launch.  The problems do have tape-recorded to that use 8 tracks on the tape but they are not the same as old 8 track tape that was used for sound storage.

    "question": "ELI5: Why is space expanding? Can we detect it? If so, what causes it to expand? If not, is there a theoretical way to detect what causes it to expand?",
    "answer": "> The way I understand it is that space is expanding constantly and while the expansion itself isn't faster than the speed of light, it appears that way because there is just so much space.  How 'fast' the expansion is depends on how far apart two points are, so saying it's faster or slower than something doesn't *really* make sense. The distance at which it becomes faster than light is the cut-off point of what we call the *observable universe*, because obviously light will never reach us coming from a galaxy that's moving away from us at faster than the speed of light.  > Is that how space is expanding?  To the best of our knowledge, space is not made of discrete cells. There are some theories which try formalizing something like this (e.g. loop quantum gravity) but the only accepted theory of the universe (general relativity) treats space as an infinitely divisible continuum.  Of course, we also know that general relativity is wrong, because it breaks down at quantum scales. So the true answer is \"we don't know\".  > Do we know how and/or why space is expanding?  No. We do know some things though: For one, space seems to have expanded *very, very* rapidly in the early universe, driven by some unknown force. We call this \"inflation\", and attempt at modeling it have sometimes attributed the cause to some currently-unknown \"inflation field\". As of today we have no evidence for or against these theories.  Also, the expansion of space seems to be *accelerating*. We don't know what causes this acceleration, which is why we gave it the name *dark energy*. So in a way, it's accurate to say that \"dark energy causes the expansion\", but that doesn't really answer the question because we don't know anything about dark energy other than that it causes the expansion of the universe.  The best guess we have at what dark energy could be is that it's caused by random quantum fluctuations, but the rate of expansion predicted by the latter and the rate of expansion we measure are off by 120 orders of magnitude.  So the correct answer is \"we don't know\".  > Can we \"zoom\" in to see it?  No. Certainly not at the energy scales we've been probing. The largest microscope ever built (the LHC) hasn't been able to detect anything relevant to quantum gravity or dark matter / dark energy.  Of course, particle physics remain convinced that if only we had an *even bigger* microscope, we *should* see something.",

The distance at which it becomes faster than light is the cut-off point of what we call the observable universe, because obviously light will never reach us coming from a galaxy that's moving away from us at faster than the speed of light.  Oh, so the space as a whole isn't accelerating; it accelerates differently depending on which two points you take?  If that's the case, have we figured out if it's the same acceleration rate for two points that are the same distance apart? If points A and B are 100 yards apart and the space between them are accelerating at 2 cm/s, and you find points C and D which happen to be 100 yards apart.. is that space accelerating at 2 cm/s as well?  >infinitely divisible continuum.  What does this mean in this context?  >For one, space seems to have expanded very, very rapidly in the early universe, driven by some unknown force.  How do we know this?

As of today we have no evidence for or against these theories.  Alright, so this got me thinking about the theory that we're one \"bubble\" of a universe in an infinite or x amount of other universes and I got to thinking about how water boils and when it boils, it bubbles. When it's bubbling, the bubble starts out small and expands and then pops and mixes back in with the rest of the water to re-boil (not taking into account evaporation). What is the chance of our universe being like similar to that, and the space being the expansion of the bubble itself? Of course this is ignoring the temperature and evaporation of said boiling.  >The largest microscope ever built (the LHC) hasn't been able to detect anything relevant to quantum gravity or dark matter / dark energy.  >Of course, particle physics remain convinced that if only we had an even bigger microscope, we should see something.  I didn't know the LHC functions as a microscope, that's cool! Are we currently planning on building anything bigger? If so, how far away are we?

There are so many different disciplines, and different approaches even within each discipline, that it's hard to single anything out.  But, okay, the core idea of analytic philosophy is that we should try to come up with precise definitions of our concepts, or at least should try to understand the implications of each competing definition.  (For example, consider the case of \"knowledge\".  When we say \"John knows that vegetables are nutritious\", we seem to be communicating to our listener both (a) that John believes that vegetables are nutritious and also (b) that vegetables really *are* nutritious.  So does any true belief count as knowledge?  Well, no.  If John believed that it was going to rain today because his Magic Eight Ball told him so then--even if it did end up raining--we probably don't want to say that John \"knew\" it was going to rain; it wasn't knowledge, just a lucky guess.  So maybe knowledge can only be a *justified* true belief.  But it turns out there are counterexamples to that, too.)  Continental philosophy, in contrast, is doing something which is about as different from analytic philosophy as poetry is from economics.  It's not seeking to clarify our concepts, but rather to elicit a certain reaction in the reader: shaking the reader out of their assumptions and prompting them to see the world in a new way.  If you want an example of each, contrast Jeremy Bentham's [Introduction to the Principles of Morals](https://www.utilitarianism.com/jeremy-bentham/) with Friedrich Nietzsche's [Thus Spake Zarathustra](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Thus_Spake_Zarathustra).",

You were trying to find the tourist information centre and you're so dumb you can't find it on a one-building map. I could tell you that it's in the top left square, but that's not helpful at all.

The humans of Earth happen to have decided on another map system though - latitude and longitude. These work pretty similarly to grind coordinates, but cover the entire globe. The idea of these is that because they use a universal system - angles away from an arbitrary centre-point - as opposed to arbitrary distances away from an arbitrary centre point, anyone can locate anything on Earth just by knowing how angles work and where the arbitrary centre point is, and if more precision is needed, a new decimal place can be added without needing to change any of the scales of the map.",

    "answer": "As someone who teaches the history of the English language, so many of these answers are driving me a bit batty for coming close but then also dropping in major inaccuracies.  Many languages are related and can be grouped into language families, and we can determine which are related because of shared vocabulary and grammatical features. Some language families are quite large and encompass many different languages, while others are quite small (Basque is an example of this). One large language family is called Indo-European, which contains many of the languages of Europe as well as some Middle Eastern languages like Persian and Pashto, as well as many languages from northern India, like Hindi and Bengali, and also some languages are dead and don't even have modern descendants, like Hittite and Tocharian. While there is not a written form of a single language that we would call Indo-European, we can make a number of hypotheses about what the shared source of its modern descendants would have looked like, especially when we focus on the oldest known forms of the languages we have, like Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit, Old Irish, etc.   For instance, here is the word for three in Old High German, Old Norse, Gothic, Old Irish, Welsh, Catalan, Romanian, Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit.  2. dri\t4. thrir\t7. threis\t1. tri\t3. tri\t5. tres\t8. trei\t10. tres\t6. treis\t9. trayas  (I have substituted th for a character that is used for the same sound in Old Norse and Gothic for the sake of readability). Based on data like this, linguists make a series of hypotheses about what the original word would have looked like. They propose that the word probably started with a tr-, that in some languages could turn into a dr- or a thr-. And then they look to see if other words fit that pattern, and they find that they do. This can be a long and slow process, and obviously it only works with words that are shared between the languages and that have tended to remain roughly the same over time. This includes words such as simple numbers, familial relationships, body parts, and common aspects of the natural world. Sometimes the patterns are really easy to see, and sometimes they're much harder to see, and sometimes they're obscured by languages that have borrowed a lot of words from another language. If you want to see examples of reconstructed Indo-European roots and how they appear in modern English words, this is a great resource: https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/indoeurop.html  This process of making hypotheses about what Indo-European looked like doesn't just cover vocabulary. It can also be used for grammar. One thing that most Indo-European languages share is a complex system of case that is used for nouns. The basic idea is that for any given noun, there were a number of different endings that would be used depending on what it was doing grammatically in the sentence. This can be hard to see today because it has almost been entirely lost in English, and really just remains as the plural -s ending and the possessive (technical term, genitive) -'s ending. The best way to think about it is to think about personal pronouns. Depending on how it is used in a sentence, you might say \"I\" or \"me\" or \"my\" or \"mine\". For a native speaker of English, you don't even have to think about which form to use. You just naturally use the correct one. In Old English, every single noun had different endings for singular and plural forms of four different cases (sometimes five). This meant that there were potentially eight different endings that could be tacked on to every single noun, although in practice there was considerable overlap, and one ending might be used in multiple cases. To make matters even more difficult, there wasn't just one pattern of endings that was used for every noun. There were a few different patterns of case-endings that might share some similarities but could also be quite different.  This is something that we see across ancient forms of a number of different Indo-European languages. A feminine word in one language that ends in a particular letter might follow one pattern, while a masculine word that ends in a different letter might follow a different one, and what is interesting is that sometimes these patterns even appear to hold true across different languages, suggesting that the patterns were inherited from a shared source.  One fairly common ending was s, often preceded by a vowel. In Old English, for instance, many plural nouns that were used as the subject or object of a sentence ended in -as. However, this wasn't the only place that an s ending appeared on a noun in Old English, nor did all plural cases end in s, nor did all Old English nouns have even a single case that ended in s. There were lots of variations that were possible, and this held true across many different Indo-European languages. Plural forms that ended in -Vs where V stands for a vowel are common enough that it is a reasonable hypothesis that it was a feature that was inherited by a number of languages. However, in the intervening years, there has been a lot of time for change. While the -s pattern became dominant in some languages, other patterns became dominant in other ones. For instance, modern English and German are fairly closely related, but the -en plural that still exists in English in words like oxen and brethren but is pretty rare is much more widespread in German.  This can lead to the impression that -s plurals are both widespread because they exist in a number of languages but also quite random, because they don't always exist in languages that we would think would be very closely related, while they do appear in languages that are much more loosely related.  I apologize for the length, and I hope that I did okay explaining some pretty technical things in an ELI5 kind of way.",

    "answer": "In ERCOT (Texas) everything was \"unbundled\" when the industry was de-regulated (or re-regulated depending on your viewpoint). So generation is independent of transmission and distribution. Energy Service Providers (ESP's) sell energy to the end consumer buy buying energy from the generators through a QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity) and delivering to the end user on transmission and distribution lines, which may or may not be one company. The distribution company (the \"Wires\" company) is the one that delivers your power to point of use. This is the one you have no choice over, since each has it's own territory.  Energy at every point (generation, transmission, distribution) is metered by extremely accurate meters that have to meet exacting standards. These are the \"settlement\" meters. There are also the meters on your home.  The \"settlement\" meters are  all time stamped at a minimum of every 15 minutes, although I believe generation is actually at 5 minute intervals. All this metering data is routed through ERCOT where generation output is matched against all the various transmission/distribution metering points, and ultimately balanced out against the end metering at your house. This is the only way it can be done, since the grid is entirely interconnected (internally), so generation is about like pumping a water well into a river, then monitoring who pulls water out.  Once all the data has been processed, fund allocations are made based on who bought what from whom at what price and what time. Even though the metering has 15 minutes intervals, the billing is usually done on an hourly basis.  Anyone can play. Grid generation is determined by who can offer \"base\" load at the cheapest price. This is the load that is pretty much there all the time. The \"intermediate\" load (i.e., the day gets warmer and load goes up from base) is the generation that is slightly more expensive. The highest cost generation comes on at peak (late afternoon in a Texas summer). The ESP's (remember them) try to study their load patterns, weather predictions, etc. and arrange through the QSE's to acquire given amounts of power at given times. Since \"anyone can play\" this means that the end user (you) can use a solar or wind turbine to generate back into the grid through your house meter and receive compensation.  ESP's are responsible for their costs. If they don't schedule enough energy, they end up paying a premium price at peak loads (aka, the recent ice storm). On the flip side, if they schedule too much and don't need it, they can either try to sell it on the market, or pay for it even though they didn't need it.  The \"wires\" companies get their money by fixed rates based on their \"cost of service\" and often tie in an extra charge based on kwh usage. They do not market \"energy\" unless they are an Electric Cooperative (which I think is unique to ERCOT). So the \"wires\" companys roll is to provide the actual service and metering.  There are more \"fun and games\" money making schemes like Congestion Revenue Rights if you want to look up an example of capitalism at it's finest (or worst).",

The bottom layer (bottom layer of the top section, so we are still in the \"epidermis\") has stem cells that can divide into new skin cells as long as those stem cells at the bottom aren't damaged. Scars happen when that stem cell layer is damaged. Think of a deep cut required for surgery vs a paper cut. Or a burn that destroys the entire epidermis. No stem cells + an open hole on your skin is going to leave you with a scar cos the body has to fill it with something so it ends up filling it with fiber (ie a scar) instead of normal skin  Stretch marks are different.

    "answer": "Conservation of angular momentum is fairly simple to understand, as long as you are looking at the components in the correct way. Every spinning object has a \"moment of intertia\" -- basically, a number you can use to represent the rotational weight of the object based on how it's being spun. There's different ways to find this, usually involving calculus... and most times you'll just have to memorize equations based on the shape you're dealing with. But once you know where your moment of inertia is, you can start playing with the actual law of conservation of angular momentum.  It's a simple equation: L = I * w  L is the actual rotational momentum (the part that remains constant, as long as no external effect on the system takes place). I is the moment of inertia, and w is the angular velocity.  So, as long as nothing is acting on the system, if you decrease your moment of inertia, the result will be that your angular momentum goes up. Imagine a figure skater doing a spin -- arms out, they aren't rotating very fast, but bringing their arms in results in spinning much faster. You can also do this on a spinning chair -- start rotating arms out, then bring your arms in for a fun ride.  &nbsp;  However, none of this really applies to the situation you're describing with the motorcycle. Yes, when going through a curve, you're technically \"rotating\", but the rotation is not significant compared to the actual motion the motorcycle is taking. Not to mention, you're referring to accelerating in a curve, which means this is no longer a closed system (the engine is now putting an external force onto the tires).  To start, let's look at things before any \"acceleration\" you describe. Obviously the motorcycle is able to maintain the curve.... but why? Let's start with what it means to go in a curve.  Any object in motion will want to keep going in the same direction at the same speed. This is one of Newton's laws. But in order to move in a curve, there has to be something causing the direction to move. In our case, it's the road pushing on the tire perpendicular to to the direction of motion. Great! We have a reason for why we're turning.  But how did we get there? Well, the tires are slightly turned to cause the change in direction, which means the tires will push against the road outward from the curve, meaning as long as friction doesn't let the tires slip, the road will push back on the tires in the \"inward\" direction of the curve (towards the center of rotation).  Ok, that's all well and good, but that just describes what's happening at the road level. If the road is pushing on the tires sideways, then without any other action, that would cause the bike to rotate outward and tip over. This makes sense -- if you just rotated the handle bars, that would be a one-way ticket to crash town!  So how do you compensate? You lean. In addition the road force, gravity is the other main force on the bike, which will always act perpendicular to the road. In order to keep things stable, the rider will always try to keep the bike in the correct angle to match the combined force of the road and gravity. The result is that the overall force felt on the bike and rider matches the centerline of that pairing, maintaining balance.  With all that figured out, the remaining thing is.... how far is the lean? This all depends on how much the road is actually pushing sideways on you for the curve -- the centripetal force. For this, the equation is F=mv^2 / R. Effectively, the tighter the turn, the more force. Also, the faster you go, the *much* more force. More force means a deeper angle needed to maintain balance. The overall limitation is on how much friction force the tires can maintain on the road to allow that turning force to happen.  &nbsp;  tl;dr Not conservation of angular momentum at play, just centripetal forces. Faster bike = more turning force needed = deeper lean to maintain balance.",

    "question": "ELI5 if prions are that bad, why aren't we more affraid of it? Or, if it's so dangerous and indestructible at the same time, why so far it hasn't been a bigger problem?",
    "answer": "The problem with prions is that they are already broken. It's like shards of glass, you can break them and break them, but no matter how much you keep breaking them, they can still cut.   Prions are bits and pieces of mis folded proteins, and they can get tangled up in our healthy proteins and cause them to become mis folded as well. It's hard to break something that is already broken, which is how we normally sterilize and sanitize.   Prion risk can be managed by preventing contamination in same species situations. For instance if you aren't a cannibal, and you don't grow food in fertilizer made from human waste, then the chances of you getting prions in your system is low.   There are some cross species prion diseases but they are rarer than same species infections. This is why it's a bad idea to feed animals feed made with that same animal (not to mention cruel). It can cause prion infections and the risk goes up exponentially.",

    "answer": "Can't answer the question though others have, but I do have a story on this -  Here in the UK we have a website called Right Move, which is basically a property listing website. Most estate agents will list on there from a small terrace house to a multi million \u00a3 mansion. A hobby for a surprising number of people (most will admit to doing the same if you mention you do it too) is to look around at really expensive properties, normally when you've bought a lottery ticket and start imagining what might happen if you win.  You can search huge areas, so I'd always look for somewhere with loads of land. Not that bothered about the house, but I always wanted to put on my own festival. I now do run festivals for a living (and I'm still poor) so realised a lottery win wasn't needed, but I digress.  I once found a place in somewhere like Oxfordshire, enormous amount of land, and oddly cheap. Looking at the photos is became weirder - several houses almost laid out like a street, in the middle of this old farmland. Anyone who's familiar with the UK would instantly recognise them as military style housing, just something about the style that gives them away. The usual smattering of farm buildings too, but they were fenced off. Not like quaint English farm fencing, full on Jurassic Park Category A Supermax prison style electric fencing.  Interest piqued, I read more into it - you were forbidden, by law with ongoing inspections by the Department of Health after purchase and continuing indefinitely, to farm and livestock or crops on the land. Ever.  More reading gave the answer - in the 1990s the UK had an outbreak of BSE or \"Mad Cow Disease\" itself a prion disease. There was footage in the news in the late 90s of cattle infected, filmed on a camcorder, footage from several years earlier that had since been declassified - cows struggling to stand, odd gait, basically \"mad\" and in the full throes of BSE. The footage was filmed at this farm - it was a UK government research centre set up to study the crisis, and was no longer needed. The infected animals were killed, incinerated, and the ashes dumped on the land. But it still isn't safe to use for any food production.  Like I say, the crisis was over by then, hence it being decommissioned, but reading further was 10 times worse than the worst horror film ever.  At one point the UK government thought BSE would turn into CJD in humans. Indeed, for a few hundred to date it has, but it has something like a 20 year incubation period, is totally incurable, and one of the worst diseases known to man. But the original fear was that anyone who'd eaten beef in the previous few decades, as in, fucking _everyone_ (vegetarianism being relatively rare in those days and beef being a stable) would develop CJD at some point in the next decade or two. Nevermind Covid, we're talking 28 Days Later type stuff.  Fortunately, for reasons I don't fully understand, but the comments have explained, it didn't happen.",

    "answer": "As others have stated (and I hope I can pack this into easy words):  The wider the wings, the more area they have and thus the more they slow down the wind that flows towards them. But this does not mean that the speed can climb to infinity.  Because you don't need to \"stop\" all the wind to make the wings go fast, you only need to stop a part of the wind flowing towards the wings. Because, as soon as you reach a certain width of the wings, they won't go faster, but instead just slow/block more wind without any further gain in speed. In fact, they might even turn slower and because more wind is stopped, more tear will happen to the whole construction!  So an engineer simulates the turbine with a simulation tool which needs to know how much energy the turbine needs to produce, with this information and data on usual wind speeds in the given area, the software calculates the perfect balance between width (and indirectly weight), length, rotation and other important stuff.  Feel free to ask if anything is unclear!",

    "answer": "They slow down moving.  Every molecule in every thing ever is moving around. How much they move around is determined by heat and how closely attracted to each other the molecules are. Gasses have molecules that aren't very strongly attracted to each other, solids have molecules that are strongly attracted to each other liquids are in between. When you cool something down the molecules slow down and the forces that attract them together have a stronger effect than when everything is moving quickly. So cooling water and turning it from a liquid to a solid isn't really creating new bonds or making the bonds stronger, what is happening is that the molecules are more effected by the forces already there.",

All that risk for what, 5 calories? Remember that bugs aren't typically available in bulk in nature. From an evolutionary standpoint, eating bugs isn't worth the effort and risk, really. Better to go for stuff like fish and large mammals, where a single kill/hunt can provide safe and nutritious food for weeks.

    "answer": "Molecules have energy and bounce around a lot. When they are in a densely packed space they bounce off of each other and off the walls of the container they are in (or molecules of ambient air inside our atmosphere). But when they are not enclosed in a container, and are in the vacuum of space, the molecules bounce off of each other and possibly never hit another molecule, which results in individual molecules shooting off in a direction never to return. This results in the gas cloud growing and dispersing over time.  This energy is too strong to be held in check simply by the gravity of the other small amount of atoms in the gas cloud. HOWEVER, if the gas cloud is VERY large then there will be a good amount of gravitational force that may result in rogue gas molecules being stopped and dragged back to the cloud. This will likely result in the formation of a star, if this gas is hydrogen.",

    "answer": "Two different approaches  Cheap setups will just have two strings of LEDs wired in parallel but pointed opposite directions sometimes called anti-parallel.  When the voltage is positive one string lights up, and when its negative the other one lights up.  The voltage flips fast enough that you don't see the flicker but sometimes if you move your hand you'll see multiple images of it like its under a strobe light (it is)  The other approach is to not run the LEDs of AC but instead run them off of DC and have a \"driver\" convert the AC into a low voltage DC that can be fed to the LEDs.  The driver will have a capacitor in it that lets it ride through the low voltage parts of the line so you can make flicker free LED bulbs this way.",
    "follow-up": "Are any LEDs made with two strings connected in opposite directions like that?   A simple [full bridge rectifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode_bridge#Rectifier) that is just 4 diode or a single small chip will flip around  AC so the same wire is positive and negative all the time.  It is technically a driver that converts it to DC but it will be DC that changed from 0 to 1.4x the AC voltage at 100/120 times per second. Do not DC as a constant voltage like it usually is   You will still need other components to limit the current that is at least a resistor.  It is not an unreasonable way to make a power indicator LED because you need to keep the reverse voltage low enough, we talk about around 5V else you kill the LED. So you can put a LED there in parallel instead of a regular diode is an option. Regular diod that has high enough reverse breakthrough voltage so the LED is protected.  So an extra LED sounds fine if you replace another diod but in LED lamps you do not have a single diode but multiple in series.  So does anyone build a LED lamp with two strings in opposite directions? It sounds like a more expensive way than just rectifying the AC",

    "question": "ELI5: Why does Tinnitus cause a constant ringing that never ceases? And why isn\u2019t it curable?",
    "answer": "This is a hard one to ELI5 but, basically, you can look at control problems in (at least) two \"domains\", ways of staring at the data. The one we're usually more familiar with is the \"time domain\"...we pick something we care about. Say, the speed of our car. And we plot it out in time. We get a nice wiggly line that shows us what speed we were going at any point in time. This is very useful for figuring out what the car was doing but not that useful for figuring out how to control it.  Another way to look at is the \"frequency domain\"...\\*any\\* squiggle in time can be converted to a combination of one or a bunch (possibly infinite) different frequency signals. So instead of plotting the thing you want vs. time, you plot out all the different frequency components and how strong they are. This turns out to be a much more useful way to look at a system for designing control systems.  The question then becomes, how do I switch between the two? Figuring out the response of a system in the time domain is \"easy\"...it's just the differential equation for the motion of the system (e.g. F=ma for a physical system). \\*Solving\\* that is horrible, but figuring out the equation is usually relatively straightforward.   The transfer function takes a time-domain description of the system, a big differential equation in time, and converts it to the frequency-domain description of the system, a differential equation in frequency. It's \\*the same system\\*, just expressed using different math. The transfer function takes an input and \"transforms\" it to the output we'll get from our particular system.  It happens that it's much easier to study/design/analyze a control system in the frequency domain. So we usually figure out the system's transfer function then design a controller transfer function that makes the system do what we want. The combination (multiplication) of the transfer functions in the frequency-domain gives us what the overall system will do. In time-domain it's not nice multiplication, which is one of the reasons we do all our work in frequency-domain. When we're all done, \\*then\\* we can back out from the transfer function (frequency) to the original time-domain equation and plot what our system actually does.",

    "answer": "- People are falling for it. As long as criminals can make money with it they will make money with it.  - The scammers are often in other countries and/or are using proxies / spoofing systems. This makes any legal investigation and charge incredibly hard, especially if countries with, lets say, less enthusiastic legal / police enforcement systems, are involved. Cooperation and legal action between countries are a thing ... for large scale operations where you can hit one criminal organization and get vast benefits out of it.   - Scam rings however tend to be rather small, very flexible and highly mobile (sometimes literally). Even if you destroy one scam organization, two new ones will pop up immediately.   - The money involved is often negligible on an individual basis. Depending on your legal coverage any kind of private action would usually cost far too much, and even for state prosecutors the effort necessary usually outweights the potential gains, as actually destroying the entire structure of the scam group would involve a large scale operation.  *Even between France and Germany it is a complicated mess, with police investigators from Germany contacting my company in France for a legal inquiry, and our standard answer \"please contact the FR authorities for an international assistance request, only they can request the data, see you in 4 month\".*  SYL",

You just don't normally see the application of those batteries because the most common household items don't *need* them. Because your TV remote doesn't need a Li-PO battery. But cell phones have become incrementally smaller and more powerful as battery technology has improved, and accessibility technology like hearing aids, cochlear implants, pacemakers, motorized prosthetics, etc. has greatly improved as batteries have improved. That may not be visible in part because as battery technology has improved, the goal wasn't to make stronger, more powerful batteries but to make them smaller without sacrificing power.

It's an area of philosophy that's fixated on that particular realization.   The Absurd is the human condition in which we find ourselves struggling to find meaning for our brief existence in a universe that is otherwise unable to provide one.  Faced with a bleak and meaningless existence riddled with pain and suffering, Absurdist philosophers attempt to answer the question \"why not just kill yourself?\". In this context, suicide is seen as the ultimate expression of free will and a forceful rejection of the Absurd yet it's a choice very few of us make (particularly among the philosophers prescribing suicide in the first place!). Why not? What is it that makes life worth clinging to?   Camus provides his answer in the *Myth of Sisyphus*, definitely worth a read if you enjoy philosophy.

    "question": "eli5: How does uranium or plutonium can store so much energy but iron or silica or why other element can't? And how come we can't get that much energy from other sources?",
    "answer": "In normal chemistry, the energy involved comes primarily from electrons getting closer and farther from nearby atoms. On a hydrogen atom, the electron gets roughly 5.3E-11 meters away from the nucleus.  The closer it gets, the stronger the forces acting on it, and so the more energy tends to be gained or lost in reactions. This rule is mostly useless for comparing chemical reactions (mainly because the different distances involved are too similar, compared to other factors), but for comparing chemical reactions to *nuclear reactions* it becomes incredibly useful.  A proton itself is about 0.85E-15 meters. This puts a proton at about 62,000 times smaller than an atom. This means that the force on two protons side-by-side will be about 3.8 billion times as strong as the force between a proton and an electron in a hydrogen atom.  As such, the energy in a reaction at the core of an atom will be astronomically larger than the energy in a reaction around the electron shells.  There are two forces involved here - an attraction and a repulsion. Protons repel each other. Neutrons attract protons. By balancing the number of protons and neutrons, larger numbers of protons can be held together without flying apart.  As your atom core gets bigger, the neutrons simply can't hold it together as well. The neutrons can really only hold onto the protons nearest them, while the force pulling them apart increases with every additional proton regardless of where in the core it is.  The result is that large atoms want to fall apart, and no amount of neutrons will change that. In fact, all atoms heavier than iron would give us *some* energy if we could break them down to iron.  However, with small atoms, the neutrons are so strong that when additional protons are added they *also* release energy. This is all atoms *smaller* than iron. By fusing these atoms together until they reach iron, we can technically gain energy from all of them as well.  This makes iron, from a completely mathematical perspective of nuclear power, the only truly useless element.  Realistically, we can only effectively harvest power from the heaviest and lightest atoms.",

A desalination plant that can produce [100 million gallons per day costs $658 million](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/innovativewater/desal/faq.asp). So for California's 38 billion gallons per day, you need to build 380 such mega-plants, which would cost **$250 billion total**. Plus the $233M per day to operate the plants.  Oh and then you have to transport all the fresh water from those 380 plants along the coast to where it's needed. Water is very heavy, so shipping is tough. You either need to move 38 billion gallons a day in train tankers + trucks, or construct thousands of miles of huge-diameter pipelines across the whole state. I don't have numbers there but both options are $$$ once again.   Overall, it's physically possible but just not feasible on the scale needed to actually help a state-wide drought.  There are environmental costs too, since desalination plants using a ton of energy also means they produce a lot of greenhouse gases. Going back to Saudi Arabia example, they estimate 25% of all oil and gas burned in the country is for desalination.  If you have a few minutes and want a pile of easily-understandable info on your exact question, I highly recommend the article [The World Can Make More Water From the Sea, but at What Cost?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/climate/desalination-water-climate-change.html) by the NY Times.",
    "follow-up": "I see i'm pretty late with my comment/question, but I was like give it a try.  I was just wondering about the same topic as OP and came to the result that in a normal household you would not be able to invest the high energy which is needed to desalinate the water. like you stated already quite reasonable.  on the other hand, if you take for example the distillation process to desalinate the water, you would need especially heat for the process. this is found in many different industries, like for example smiths, car production, even heated places like pool areas or similar. of course this would need an inital investment, like first how to combine a distillery (if that's even tje process of desalination) with the machines of that particular industry and second the money to build that. but once implemented it would not really create extra costs as the heat is there anyways and the water could be distributed from there.   so is it really needed to build up desalination plants instead of using what is already there?  hope i was able to get my thoughts over, english is not my first language.",

Judicial decrees include things like arrest warrants, bail terms, that sort of stuff. This means they hunt fugitives, which is probably where most of their video game involvement comes from.  Marshalls don't generally investigate the way that cops or the FBI do. A judicial decree is something given to a specific person, so there's no whodunit to solve. A Marshall would only be involved after someone else has taken care of that part.   They do have some peace-keeping and security roles like other law enforcement, but only in specific scope. Security of the courthouse itself, and I think sometimes transporting prisoners.   ^1 Technically Marshalls are still *part* of the Executive branch.

For example, having a child with a first cousin when you're 20 years old is probably ***less*** likely to result in a disabled baby than having a child with someone unrelated when you're 30 years old, but nobody objects to the latter.

Didn't your freedom to sell the drug just hurt someone else?    Now from another view of something that is specifically *only* affecting your body. Lets say you grow and use your own drugs because it's legal to do so. One day, you use too much of your drugs and you die. Now your family just lost a member who was \"only doing what they want with their own body\"....do you think your family would be hurt by that? Surely probably not physically, but emotionally they might be completely devastated, which could have physical effects too. So your right to \"do what you want with your own body\" just caused harm to your family.    Ultimately, there is no perfect solution. Humans are social creatures and tend to desire to live together in some form of society. If there were no laws it would be chaos, if there are laws you **must** give up some freedom to allow those laws to exist. Even if the laws *only* cover actions/activities/whatever that directly affect each individual person in their own right, you must still draw a line somewhere to determine \"by allowing person A to do X, is there *any* effect that can affect other people?\" If your concern is \"allowing things that don't hurt anyone, period\", then you *need* to restrict the use of anything that takes away that users ability to maintain proper and full control of themselves both mentally and physically, otherwise they could use something that might cause them to hurt another with zero intent to do so prior to using.    Now, I will say I do mostly agree with you, there are too many laws that unnecessarily restrict an individuals freedom.....but I don't know that there's any solution to grant those freedoms that can't, at least in some way, be tied to harm towards others.",

    "answer": "Traditionally in a car, the gas pedal would be connected by a cable to a valve that would let more fuel into the engine. In these cars, what you probably would expect to happen does happen-- as you take your foot off the clutch, if you do not press the gas pedal the engine rpm will drop (and likely stall, unless the car is idling fast).  In modern cars, the gas pedal is basically a joystick that's connected to the car's computer, and that computer decides how much gas goes into the engine. Instead of just having a set amount of gas to make the engine idle, the computer will adjust the amount of gas to get a consistent idle speed. When you start to take your foot off the clutch, the engine will initially start to slow down, but the computer will quickly step in and put more gas into the engine to compensate. The idle speed you want is pretty much the slowest speed the engine can do without stalling, so the computer will be careful to not let the speed fall, and instead actually speed it up a bit over the idle speed to keep the engine from stalling (in the case that you're not already asking for more by stepping on the gas).",

To some extent, it really is a matter of developers learning to use the hardware more effectively. This is a process that never really stops, and it leads to incremental improvement over time, to a limited degree.  But you mentioned how Sony and Microsoft released hardware upgrades for the PS4 and XBone, and this leads to the other big reason: hardware upgrades to a cobsole's capabilities are not as new as many people think. The main difference is that with disc and digital consoles, these upgrades generally require you to buy a new console or at least swap out bits of the hardware: you can't put more RAM on a disc or download a better video processor.  But on the older cartridge-based systems, hardware upgrades were often built into the games themselves. The NES is especially notorious for its proliferation of different kinds of upgrade chips. Nintendo called most of its upgrades Memory Management Controllers (MMCs), but in a more general sense people call them mappers now. There were limits to what a mapper could do -an NES is still an NES- but these were used to enhance memory, add features like split-screen and larger sprites, and on the Famicom it was even possible to enhance the games' sound (this last didn't work on the NES because of some foolish early decisions on NOA's part). The SNES had its own mappers, as did the Game Boy and the Genesis, but nothing else ever took them to the degree that the NES did.",

    "question": "eli5: What is a gradient? That's it.",
    "answer": "This hopefully counts as eli5 answer: gradients tell you how fast a thing changes. So you need two inputs: what is the thing you're looking at, and what's the knob you turn to make the thing change. Usually the first input is a number, or numbers, say, the temperatures of every key on your keyboard. There are typically two knobs to turn: the time knob or the \"space\" knob. They just return different gradients. The time knob will take only one key of the keyboard as input and will tell you how fast the current temperature of that key changes over time. Use another key as input, and you get the current change of temperature. This is a gradient over time, it will tell you how the input temperature changes at one point on the keyboard.  The other knob is the spatial knob. It takes as input the key again, but it will tell you how the temperature changes as you move from this key down, or left. So while the first gradient is change in temperature per minute, the second is change in temperature per inch. As such, a gradient can be used as prediction. If you know the current temperature of a key and the time-gradient, you can calculate roughly how warm the key will be in 3 minutes. And likely: if you know the spacial gradient, you can estimate how warm the key on the left is.  Edit: using time and space knobs are the most common  gradients. But there are more knobs, generally anything that has an influence on your input can be used as knob: everything else returns a very boring gradient that is 0 everywhere, no matter how much you turn that knob, your input doesn't change.",

This has the advantage that you don't need a drive shaft running through the length of the car. The engine and transmission can also be installed as a compact unit which makes assembly easier and faster.  All the engine weight also pushes down on the drive wheels which helps with traction and braking and therefore makes the car safer.  Making cars 4 wheel drive requires a much more complex transmission with a drive shaft to the rear as well as the front. This adds cost and complexity and has some disadvantages as well, but the manufacturer believes the upsides outweigh the downsides.",

    "question": "ELi5 Why are stars typically bigger than planets?",
    "answer": "Because this is how we define stars, planets and moons.  For planets and moons this is easy. If planets weren't bigger than their moons they wouldn't be planets. Moons are things that orbit planets. Orbiting is based on relative mass (smaller things orbit bigger things), so if a planet had a moon bigger than it, the planet would be the moon and the moon the planet. If they were similar sizes they'd orbit around each other, and wouldn't count as proper planets - instead being maybe dwarf planets or something similar.  For stars and planets we need to be careful what we mean by \"bigger.\" What makes stars stars and not planets is that they are *massive* enough (so have enough mass) that the are undergoing nuclear fusion. If you get enough mass together in one region, gravity pulls it in hard enough that the stuff starts squishing in awkward ways and explodes. Stars are a balance between gravity imploding the stuff they're made of, and fusion exploding it again.  So generally stars need to be larger in size than planets because - roughly speaking - stars and planets are made up of the same stuff, and if planets were bigger they'd probably have enough mass to start exploding and turn into stars.  That said, you do get some very small stars. Based on [this list of small stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_smallest_stars), around 20 of them are smaller than Jupiter - mostly White Dwarf stars and Neutron Stars. These are incredibly dense - they may have similar amounts of mass to the Sun (so enough mass to undergo fusion and so be stars), but that mass is squished down to an object maybe on a few kilometres across for the smallest.  To quote [Wikipedia's definition of a planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet):  > A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is **not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion,** and ... **has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals**.

We already see global standardization in plenty of areas, and sometimes those things are triggered by one country's or groups preference.   The EU has created several things that have trickled into the rest of the world mostly because it's easier to comply than have different versions of things country by country.  GDPR is an example of the EU that is forcing pretty much every site on the internet to ask if you're OK with the site using cookies. Is it on every website? Absolutely not. If you want have any hope of doing business in Europe with some kind of website, you have to comply. Otherwise that market is basically closed to you.     I'm not claiming that unified global standards are required, or even that we *should* transition to them. But it is still a curiosity of mine why certain things have latched on, and others haven't.",

    "answer": "There are many reasons (some good some otherwise usually in hindsight) to issue new shares. Public companies cannot \"simply\" issue new shares within their authorized limits. It requires the approval of the BOD who represent the current shareholders.  Some basic reasons:  1) Issuing shares to acquire another company. The new shares are exchanged for shares in the acquired company. Clearly the intent is to increase the value of the company beyond that of the value of the issued shares.   2) Issuing shares to get more capital for major investment. Again, this is with the intent of increasing the value of the company, perhaps in the long term.  3) Issuing shares in exchange for retiring debt. Kind of a desperation measure or one forced through negotiations with creditors. This also happens in cases of bankruptcy.",

Your body just gets used to periods without food and you get less hungry, meaning you eat a bit less overall and that's how you lose weight.   Just to be clear, you don't eat constantly for your 6 eating hours. You just make sure your meals fall within that time slot.    It's really not much different from just skipping breakfast.

That tangled loop of string is called a *knot*, and knot theory is the mathematical study of them. It also looks at *links*, which are multiple knots looped together.

As I understand it, one of the main things knot theory looks at is knots viewed in higher dimensions. In these cases it is absolutely possible to untangle the knot you showed as an example, and as a rule any knot in n-dimensional space can be untangled when embedded in (n+1)dimensional space as there\u2019s more room to manoeuvre things (which would give the appearance of parts of the knot moving through itself when viewed in the original n-dimensional space).",

    "question": "ELI5: How do racists enjoy sports?",
    "answer": "A battery is technically a group of cells but we often refer to a single cell as a battery. Depending on the chemistry a cell will have a characteristic voltage when charged. Lead-acid batteries like a car battery are around 2.2 volts per cell. Nickel-cadmium is around 1.2 volts per cell, various lithium-based cells are a little over 3 volts per cell.   When a battery is used, a chemical reaction occurs as energy is removed in the form of electricity. Once the chemicals used in the reaction are used up the battery is discharged and the voltage drops to the point where the battery can no longer produce electricity.   Some batteries like flashlight batteries aren't designed to be recharged. When the chemicals are used up, attempting to recharge the battery fails as the reaction can't be easily reversed. These are called primary batteries. When they are used up they are discarded.   Other battery types are rechargeable. The chemical reaction can be reversed by putting electricity back in to the battery. This gets complicated. If you put energy in to the battery too fast, it doesn't all get used to reverse the reaction. The extra energy is turned in to heat which will damage the battery. Also, once the reaction is complete and the battery is fully charged, extra energy then gets converted to heat, also damaging the battery.  The way the battery is used determines how we design a charger. For an electric car like a Tesla, we want to charge the battery quickly so that we can get back on the road without waiting around. These chargers put a lot of energy into the battery but are careful to shut off when the heat begins to rise so that the battery isn't damaged. We need to charge the battery fast to get back on the road but must carefully monitor the state of charge to prevent damage. This fast charger is expensive and complicated.   Consider a different use case, the battery in a backup power supply for a computer UPS. It will go weeks or months without a power failure. There's no need to charge it fast. We can put a trickle of electricity in to it constantly with an inexpensive charger built in to the UPS. There's no real need to worry about heat damage because the amount of energy we're applying is very low, but it will take a very long time to recharge the battery. This type of trickle charger is very inexpensive to make.   There's a technical point that's kind of tough for a five-year-old to understand about this. True trickle chargers continue to supply a small amount of energy as long as they're connected. They don't look at the battery voltage. Once the reaction is complete, the trickle charger continues to supply energy. The battery is being \"overfed\" gradually over a very long time. This can also damage the battery. Most of what we call trickle chargers are actually float chargers. A float charger provides a constant voltage based on the chemical type of the battery. The better float chargers adjust this voltage based on temperature because the battery's optimal voltage can change with temperature. Float chargers are slightly more expensive than true trickle chargers but they don't damage the battery by overcharging. A discharged battery consumes this energy and the recharging reaction occurs slowly over time. When the battery is fully charged, the chemical reaction stops because the voltage is equal to that being supplied by the charger. Often what we call a trickle charger is actually a float charger by design.   There are also chargers that operate in different modes to charge a battery quickly until it's mostly charged, then switch to float mode to avoid damage. These are often called \"smart\" chargers. Off-grid solar is a prime example. You want to charge the battery fast when the sun shines, but switch to float to avoid damage on a long sunny day.",
    "follow-up": "So if I want to make a battery that can be charged via solar, I have to see that they are under the category 'smart'. That means, under heavy sun, it should recharge the battery under full speed, and also whenit's full, it should switch to 'float' charger.  *(Different topic)*, Many people say that overnight charging is bad for your battery. Is our mobile chargers 'trickle' charger, because even though the battery is full (voltage difference zero), chargers still continue to supply voltage?",

Less healthy food tends to be freezable or pumped full of preservatives so they are stable for many months.   Healthy food stakes planning and more preparation. And fresh food tends to cost more. And food like hot dogs, chicken nuggets, etc. are made from random bits of animal carcasses, not nice cuts that are more expensive.   Then add picky kid tastes to the equation. Ever try to get a 5 year old to eat a salad for dinner? How about a family of 5? You tend to target your menu to the lowest common denominator, taste wise.",

It's like watching a live play if I were to thoroughly know the script. I know what each person is going to say and when, and after every line I'm looking toward the next person for their next line. They come through!  One of the oddest sensations was at a new job when I did not know the people in the room well at all, and didn't yet know much about what they were talking about. Two of them I had never before heard in conversation. But I knew what they were all going to say in turn as soon as the conversation started. It was weird.

Gender dysphoria (often times the reason someone may want gender reassignment surgery like you've described) is an extreme discomfort some have with their gender. I'm a trans guy, so I wasn't born as a boy, but I'm so personally uncomfortable with people calling me \"she\" and with some aspects of my body that I've started to use testosterone to change my appearance so that other people might see me how I see myself. This isn't a problem I have with my body as a whole, but rather very specific aspects of it that are related to how one might perceive my gender based on how I look (like my chest, for example).  This discomfort was so extreme for me personally that I suffered from a lot of depression and suicidal thoughts during my teens before I could transition. It still is a bit extreme, given I'm not done transitioning yet, but the hormones have helped immensely, along with the support I've received from friends and family.  If you have any other questions (specifically about gender dysphoria), I'll do my best to answer them. I hope this all makes sense.",

That takes a couple of years.   2.) You can think of memories as being part of a giant \u201cweb\u201d of neurons in the brain. You are able to retrieve a memory as long as the strings connected to that memory are intact. When we\u2019re little, our brains grow *a lot*. New connections are constantly being formed, and many of those connections disrupt the parts of the web of memories that has already formed. And once the old connection is broken, it becomes very difficult to access those memories.   3.) The last reason is just that we don\u2019t know *what* we\u2019re supposed to remember. Absolutely everything is new and everything *feels* big and important. But even as adults, there\u2019s a limit to how much we can process at once...so we usually get rid of the stuff that\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter as much to make room for the important memories.

Instead of 1 2 3 (3 different numbers) you go 123 (1 number). It puts less stress on the ability to remember and makes you more able to remember more stuff.   Spaced repetition works like this. Say you're doing flashcards. You get 3 right and 1 wrong. You focus on the one you got wrong in each session. It basically just works cause firing the same neural connections over and over, which is how we remember stuff anyway.  Memory palace is a way to remember objects or things. Say you need a red box and a brown spider and a yellow hand. So you literally imagine a room with those things in it and it helps you remember them.

The second means the rings were always there, and are stable enough to last 4.5 billions years, implying they are going nowhere.

    "question": "ELI5: Why are polypeptides sensitive across narrow ranges of temperature/pH?",
    "answer": "Polypeptides get their function once they're \"folded\" into their shape. This folding is so sensitive that even extremely small changes, like a slight change in an amino acid's orientation, can drastically affect how good the protein is at its job, like catalyzing reactions or forming cellular structures. On a basic level, the shape they take on is a function of two main things, how it interacts with itself and how it interacts with its environment. Any changes to either of those will give you a slightly differently folded protein and likely affect its function. As a result, polypeptides are usually extremely optimized for the environment they're going to exist in, and why our bodies work so hard to maintain a consistent environment within itself.  pH is the probably the easiest to understand. One thing to remember is that pH is logarithmic, meaning even small changes in the pH value means orders of magnitude of change in the environment of the polypeptide. As nearly half of the amino acids that make up all of our proteins have some kind of pH sensitive portion of their molecules, any fluctuations in the pH of their environment will cause them to become \"more charged\" or \"less charged\", which will affect both how the peptide as a whole interacts with itself and its environment. This will in turn affect its folding (and in some cases, also affect chemical reactions it can carry out, as some of these rely on certain amino acids being protonated/deprotonated to work).   As for temperature, you're affecting both how the polypeptide interacts with itself and with its environment simultaneously by basically giving the system more energy. A lot of protein folding is based on molecular interactions like hydrogen bonding, which are sensitive to the temperature of the system. Too much energy in the system and the desired attractive forces can kind of get \"overwhelmed\", while if it's too cold, new undesired interactions can start dominating. The end result is the same, a change in the protein folding which affects its function.  Hope that helps! I have a background in this stuff (and am still studying it in a way) so I'd be happy to go more or less in detail.",

Eels have a specialised organ that momentarily produces a difference in eletric potential (Voltage) along a series of cells in the eels body.

This momentary voltage source finds its path of least resistance through various outlets on the eels body and shocks the would be predator.   To correct a few details from other comments, there will always a be a \"destination\" for charge to flow to. Current is the amount of charge flowing through a specific point at any given time, and resistance is a scalar. The amount of current flowing through a circuit is proportional to the voltage. This proportionality is the resistance.",

Current doesn't choose paths, it will flow through all available paths in inverse proportion to the resistance of each one.

Let's say you have a 12 V source and a 3 ohm and 6 ohm resistor in parallel; 4 A will flow through the 3 ohm resistor and 2 A will flow through the 6 ohm resistor. Now if you remove the path of least resistance, the 3 ohm resistor, what happens to the current through the 6 ohm resistor?

    "answer": "BLOB storage stands for binary large object. It's very simply a service which allows you to store and retrieve any binary data somewhere. Binary data is just a stream of 1's and 0's and is the backbone of all computer storage.   The storage itself offers no user interface, no Web page or anything. It has no concept of file types or folders - you just tell it a path (you could just make one up) and the data is stored at that path. The path is really just a label that you have to know to be able to get the data back again. Its up to you to store any information about what you've stored where. (If you loose this information the BLOBs can become \"orphaned\" - this means you don't know where or what exists.)   Many BLOB storage offerings don't allow the data to be edited. You can write new data, read existing data or delete data. You just send or request raw data from an address using some networking protocol. You can basically just make a network request which says: \"store 100101101 at location /my/stuff/data\". It's up to you to have some software that can send this request correctly. The provider will make the protocol freely available so anyone can write some software that can use it. You could also do a request that says \"get data from /my/stuff/data\" and it will literally just send 100101101 back to you. It's up to your software as to how it interprets that information (is it a file, is it just a data point?). BLOB storage stores no relational information which is what makes it distinct from a database. (Relational data is a bit like a spreadsheet - you can filter and transform the data to get the data you want)  The cloud storage services put a nice web/app interface on top of the BLOB storage which gives you concepts like folders, drag and drop e.t.c.

Bitcoin operates by \"mining\" those serial numbers, for each unit of their currency, a bit coin.  They do this by using a computer to calculate a new serial number, and there's a peer-to-peer authorized stack of all the known bitcoin serial numbers (and their transactions).  So lets say you made your computer make a bitcoin with serial number 12345, everyone else would \"know\" that it was created by you, when it was created, and when you used it to buy something and it changed ownership to someone else.  Except that serial number could be something like 64 letters long, and use every lower case, uppercase, and other text characters.  That's why they use a computer to generate & check the serial number.  --  How it becomes an issue - the mining programs out there, used to generate new numbers, and check against the stack, have been written to use a LOT of computational power.  Not just the CPU, the main processor, but also the GPU, the graphics processor.  And that has lead to a situation where, because of non-graphics purposes, the bitcoin miners are buying all the top-of-the-line graphics cards (and whatever other hardware they can get) to do their mining better/faster, due to having a better/faster set of hardware to do it.  It gets even \"worse\" when you figure that the serious bitcoin mining operations aren't just using 1 or 2 computers, they're using dozens or hundreds.",

Even the dopamine pump above uses a modified version of dopamine that can, but we can't always do that well.  Second, when you dump a bunch of hormones or chemicals on the body the body reacts by making less of that hormone itself to try to keep itself in balance. This can sometimes cause serious side effects.  Third, very very few problems in the brain are due to a simple issue of \"not enough of a single chemical\" (even Parkinson's, which is basically caused by the brain not being able to make dopamine anymore, is more complicated) You don't water plants in your house with a fire hose because the water that's really good for the plants isn't so great for your computer on the desk next to them.

    "follow-up": "This is NOT how this works at all. Its a funny explanation, but 100% not how this actually works and should not be considered an actual explanation.  Simple explanation: When aroused, your body changes to an aroused state and chemicals are released that create urges and make you want to \"get-down\". These urges can override your critical thinking skills like any other natural evolutionary urges/feelings (Hunger, Tiredness, Anger, etc.).  Once the urges are taken care of, your body stops releasing these chemicals, and your brain goes back to its neutral state where these urges no longer play into decision making and judgement. You maybe made a bad decision about who your partner was or if you should have done it at all because evolution only cares that you DID it (evolution likes babies to keep a species alive). having regrets after has no positive effect on the propogation of the species, so it doesnt matter.  Think about when you get extra hungry, shouldnt you just want MORE food even if its healthy (Ie; DAMN I COULD EAT LIKE 5 SALADS RN)? No, these chemicals can skew your judgement to want UNHEALTHY food because it wants more of the fun \"easy\" calories to get through the dip in energy quickly.

    "question": "ELI5 How exactly does a countries' increasing fiscal debt result in a deterioration in quality of life?",
    "answer": "There is a point about national debt that helped me understand it better: the debt cannot be recalled whenever the borrower wants. The bonds the government uses to borrow money have fixed terms and interest rates, so all payments are incredibly predictable. The government always knows exactly how much it needs to pay in a given month or year.  It also knows how much it might owe in a given month or year if it takes on 2 trillion dollars in additional  debt to fund covid stimulus or infrastructure.    As long as these predictable payments don't make up a large portion of the budget, it really doesn't matter how big the actual total debt number is.    Problems occurr when a country cannot keep up with it's payments.  At that point, the only option is to print the money, which causes high inflation. Then nobody wants to borrow money from that country anymore, so they have a hard time serving their people after that.  Currently, the US spends about 6% of it's budget on servicing it's debt.  This is very manageable, and we actually have quite a bit of room to take on more debt if need be.",
    "follow-up": "6% of its budget on debt is very high.   So it sounds like a game of hot potato. Whereby the country needs to keep up with payments and not let it accumulate at a rate and size that it cannot manage.   So, the more debt means the more payments that need to be made at a more frequent rate. However the rate that debt has to be paid cannot be linear with the amount of debt on paper, due to compounding nature of interest.   Therefore, if the country should struggle to meet payments it will struggle very quickly and be overwhelmed. And if the US, should get overwhelmed then it can just get the federal reserve to print more money to pay off the immediate debt owed, but then that would just put the country in more debt... And on and on it goes... Essentially, this is how reccessions and depressions happen.  Is that correct?",

    "answer": "There's no inherent link between increasing debt and a deterioration in quality of life. In fact, borrowing money to pay for stuff generally stimulates the economy. As long as a country can pay debts on time and creditors are willing to keep loaning money, there's no problem.   The latter is usually where you run into problems. If lenders lose confidence, they'll stop lending, and a country that's reliant on borrowing money has to stop, meaning cuts to government spending or tax increases. Countries almost never increase taxes on the wealthy who can and should pay their fair share, so you end up with tax increases that hurt the average person and cuts to government spending that almost always come from social services like social security, healthcare, education...etc.  It's worth noting that economically strong countries wield this as a weapon against developing nations. Economically powerful countries like the U.S. U.K. France, Germany....etc will refuse to loan money to other countries, either directly or through their control of the IMF and the world bank, unless those countries lower taxes on the wealthy and corporations, make big spending cuts, and privatize, which are all things that dramatically lower the quality of life of the average person.",

    "answer": "At the scale of cloud droplets viscosity is a force vastly superior to gravity. Gravity is applied to mass, viscosity* is applied to surface area, and smaller things have more surface than they have mass. Imagine you drop a stone into water - it will sink to the bottom right away. Now if you grind this stone into sand and let this sand fall into water it wouldn\u2019t sink right away, despite being the same mass. It will take its time, and if you stir this sand just a little, it will make a swirling sand cloud in the water which can persist for a few minutes - precisely because sand particles have much more surface area than the original stone while having the same mass. The same thing happens with water droplets in the cloud. Very small water droplets just float on the upward air currents (note that thunderclouds form when there are strong upward currents to begin with). When this droplets become bigger by joining each other (reducing their overall surface area) they start falling to the ground making rain.  Edit: *viscous friction actually.",
    "follow-up": "Awesome explanation! I love the analogy. To add a little color, you undersell the strength of updrafts in thunderstorms. They're intense! 5000 fpm (60 mph, 100kph) is normal, and they can get much stronger still. It's no wonder raindrops don't fall through it, that's enough updraft to keep a lot of things aloft. Small planes have been known to get sucked in the bottom and tossed out the top of big thunderstorms. So how does rain eventually fall? Well it's heat that's driving the updraft (hot air rises) and all that enormous mass of water is being pushed up to where it is extremely cold. Eventually all that water is cold enough to cool that updraft until it's not quite powerful enough to hold the water aloft, and it all starts coming down. As it starts falling it chills the updraft from bottom to top, killing it off, while dragging cold air downward with it. All those millions of tons of water just drop in one big, massive SPLAT of rain, now driven by a powerful downdraft of very cold air called a microburst. (In a big Midwestern supercell the winds at high levels push the updraft a little diagonal, so when the cold rain falls it misses the updraft and didn't cool and kill the it at all. That's why those thunderstorms get really really ridiculously powerful).",

    "answer": "Let me try and explain the European club football pyramid:  First, the most important point: All professional football teams in Europe play under the same umbrella, that is called UEFA. UEFA runs the highest club competition in Europe, called the UEFA Champions League, whose winner is the European champion. The teams that will play in any given year's Champions League are the previous year's winners of the national leagues of European nations.  Oh, yes, the national leagues: Parallel to the Champions League, every nation also has its own leagues. England has its own, called the Premier League, my country Turkey has the S\u00fcper Lig, etc. The qualification process varies by country depending on that country's teams' previous performance, but by winning the national league, any team in any given European country could go and get to play in the Champions League, and win it and become the European champions if they are good enough.  Each nation has lower divisions of their leagues too, but those divisions are all interconnected with the top division. At the end of each season, the top teams in lower divisions switch places with the bottom teams in the higher division, a process known as 'promotion and relegation'. This ensures that, if I and a bunch of my friends decided to form a team in our Turkish town tomorrow, after enough victories in the following years, we could theoretically get promoted to the Turkish S\u00fcper Lig, win that, go to the Champions League, win that, and become the European champions. Improbable, sure, but theoretically not impossible. By winning enough games for a long enough time, any team could win the Champions League.  Every other continent also has a similar system to determine their continental champion. Every year, the winners from all 6 continents play in the  FIFA Club World Cup. The winner is crowned the world champion.  Now these 12 rich teams owned by bastards have decided to bypass this whole system by creating their own league in place of the Champions League. They seem to like the American system of 'closed league', where the owners of teams decide who gets to play, where even after years of horrendous performance you just continue to be part of the competition, where new teams (which are referred to as 'franchises', ugh) have to ask for permission from the league to be part of it.  This would make the entirety of European leagues pointless. Sure, the national leagues would continue to exist, but with no way of joining this 'Super League' besides invitation, and no way for the 'founding clubs' to ever not qualify for it, pretty much all the excitement of European football is being stolen.",

After 6 months with this bank, your total + interest will be $1.50. Then another 6 months later it would be $2.25, getting $0.75 from 50% of the $1.50.  So it would seem that even if the % interest adds to the same 100%, getting it more often leads to giving you more money! So what about a bank that offers 25% interest every 3 months?

    "question": "ELI5: How does a USB-C charger stay in the port?",
    "answer": "That's a fantastic question! Two factors: laminar flow and available thrust.  Laminal flow occurs when the particles of a fluid follow a surface uniformly and smoothly. In our case, air over a wing. Wings essentially generate lift by having a low-pressure zone over the top-back of the wing, \"sucking\" the plane up. When air moves too slowly, however, the laminal flow can [break](https://www.google.com/search?q=wing+stall&sxsrf=ALeKk01xnmsdV5J5QFZXOmJy8uV_gpfhJQ:1619102167801&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3gMTMiZLwAhURvp4KHZRpBPYQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw#imgrc=RNB3riuiAq8bcM) and the wing no longer generates lift.  Now, let's say we have some sort of magical engine that can produce as much thrust as we want instantaneously. With practice, we could almost never enter a stall configuration by simply pitching the aircraft up, and stepping on the gas. Tragically, modern aircraft don't have this much thrust.  \\> Is the most extreme possible rate of climb just as safe as a lower rate?  Nope! Let's say we're in some modern jet with huge amounts of power, an F-16 for example. If we have an extremely high pitch (leaving AoA out of this for now), maybe something like 45 degrees, we're exchanging altitude directly for speed. Once we get up to maybe, 35,000 feet (the upper range of the F-16's ceiling), we're at 115 knots, and we want to level out. It would be much more difficult to level the aircraft because one, the atmosphere is much thinner at altitue, and two, we have less aerodynamic influence from our control surfaces because of our low speed. If we ascended as a lower pitch range (something like 15 degrees), it would be much easier to level and control the aircraft throughout the ascent's duration, but it would take much longer to climb, if that makes sense.  \\> Does optimal fuel consumption factor in?  Yes! Research Top Of Climb and Top Of Descent calculations.  \\> If I hypothetically just wanted to ascend as quickly as I could, what are the limitations and dangers and catches?  Stalling. Let's say we're in our F-16 again, and this time we're using all 23,000 lbs of thrust to climb vertically, straight up, 90 degrees. If' we're at some insane speed, 950 knots lets say, and we gradually pull up to 90 degrees, we could climb very quickly at the expense of 'burning off' our momentum. Once we reach the apogee of our climb, the airspeed would be zero, and we would be generating no lift at all. Basically, the biggest issue with quickly climbing is knowing when to level and how to not stall, but these are hugely exaggerated situations.  \\> Are there similar limits and concerns when it comes to descending?  Sort of! To become a private pilot, one of the things you have to learn is how to perform an emergency descent. Essentially if someone on your aircraft is having a medical emergency, you know how to descend as quickly as possible, with as much speed as possible, to get on the ground safely, all without tearing your airplane to shreds.  The biggest problem with descending is overspeeding and overstressing the airframe. Aircraft have operating limits (my C172's maximum speed, or VNE (speed never exceed) is 163 knots), so if I descend improperly and hit a speed of say, 210 knots, it's much more likely I can severely damage the airframe, if not first the control surfaces or empennage.  TL;DR: Thrust is more or less equal to speed, and if you don't have enough speed you stall.  source: am pilot",
    "follow-up": "Thanks, this is really helpful!  So I have a few possibly embarrassing follow-up questions, extremely hypothetical lol:  From what I understand, the laminal flow breaking seems to do mainly with the changing of the wing's angle relative to the direction the plane is moving (i.e. the wing is not fully \"piercing\" the air in front of it anymore). So what if a plane simply takes off at an incline so that the air moving over the wing is already coming closer to straight at it from above? Could the same aircraft handle a sharper ascent this way since it doesn't have to pitch upward to begin with? Is this method just not worth the loss of fuel efficiency/passenger comfort/ease of using simple runways, or do the basic physics just not even play out the same way for some reason? Or am I missing something more fundamental?  Also (this is probably a bonkers question but I'm just curious now), what if a plane took off not purely by thrust, but by rolling down a decline to pick up speed, off a ledge, then used less fuel to turn that speed into lift with the assisting momentum? Is this just too much of a hassle/not worth whatever small amount of fuel it might save?",

You're probably already selling as much as you can, so the easiest way to have the lowest possible expenses is to pay your employees as little as you can get away with.

Theres a snowball effect that takes place here - the bigger Amazon gets, the more money and influence you have and the more you're able to accept risks and expand your company - big companies have an easier time getting even bigger than smaller ones.

Both Roman Architecture and Islamic Architecture were base on Persian architecture (not Greek, except as decoration) and while in the West slowed, in Islam flourished.  With the start of the Renaissance a trend of imitating and studying old Rome became fashionable, often studying translations or original Classical books collected by Islamic scholars, plenty in Cordoba.  Now, the fact that the centers of development transfer to Europe is another story, but the Neoclassical is a companion to modernity and it's a fabrication of a supposed heritage. For most of history Europe was a left-over of the centers of knowledge of Al-Andalus, the Maghreb, and the Levant. Most similarities with Rome are later additions to make ourselves heirs of that.

    "answer": "It's because they're not really just things by themselves. They're convenient labels.  Simple example from physics: velocity.  Velocity is a simple descriptive word for \"distance covered over time\". To get velocity of an object you divide how much distance (inches, feet, miles, whatever) it covered by how much time (seconds, hours, whatever) it took to cover it. It's useful so we invented a more convenient-to-use word for it.  If you look up the definition of a joule you get \"kilogram meter squared per second squared\". That's way too much of a mouthful so we just call it a joule.",

    "answer": "For the huge majority of our history, meat was a rarer food source compared to always-available plants. Eating as much meat as possible whenever it *was* available was therefore an evolutionary advantage.  In the last 100 years meat is now available cheaply everywhere, but that's WAY too fast a change for evolution to have registered yet, so we all still have the \"ooh! Meat = rare feast!\" program running in our brains.",
    "follow-up": "I know this is the accepted theory, and I think a nice cut of red meat was indeed rare, but the definition of meat is much larger. Squirrels are quite easy to kill. Mollusks are gathered, crawdads too. I am sure insects were part of the diet. I have caught fish by hand. When the pilgrims landed, lobsters were on the beach. Were there ample plants in winter? When I was a kid, I made all kinds of primitive weapons. I chipped my own arrowheads. I made sinew from deer hides for bowstrings. Slings and atl atls are simple and effective with practice. I got my inspiration mostly from a primitive skills and survival book written by a guy named Larry Dean Olsen. If I could do those things from learning from a book, mostly by myself, then primitive man, having nothing else to do but these things in a world with much more living things, would have little trouble getting enough protein.  I pick berries that grow behind my house. If you have never done this, you would be surprised at the amount of time and effort it takes to fill a mason jar. I pick wild mushrooms as well. They are great, but they depend on weather and time of year. I think small game is an often overlooked source of calories by history books. My theory is this: We crave meat and protein because of the nutrient density. Basically herbivores do the work of concentrating nutrients and that keeps us from having to graze all day long and it allows us to live in many climates. I think we evolved eating lots of stuff, more than mostly plants. I have read the theory that we evolved our intellect from eating both land based and water based proteins and fats, especially omega oils. That seems very plausible to me  I think we ate more animal based food than is commonly accepted.",

    "answer": "Yes and no. Both a dancer and a karate-ka are very good at how they move their body and generating the required forces. However, it is their foundations that differ. A karate-ka will spend hours training how to block, strike, and kick, whereas a dancer spends hours training different moves (I'm not a dancer, my sister was, I can't name any of the things she did lol).  Both get to be good at moving their body and memorizing patterns of moves, and a good dancer could become a good at kata and vice versa, but they need the other training too. A dancer couldn't just learn the kata and be able to execute it the same.  I have world medals for kata and my sister has national medals for ballroom dance. No way could I dance like her if she taught me the moves (trust me, we tried!). And she can't do kata like I can. But with a lot of training, it would require less effort for each of us to get better at the other's sport because we understand how to move our bodies more than someone who doesn't do a sport like that.",

The most precise measurements are based on the [Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background).  There is a convenient reference frame called the [comoving frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoving_coordinates#Comoving_coordinates), in which the CMB light coming from all directions is equally redshifted.  This is also the reference frame in which the universe is the oldest, and is the reference frame we use when doing most cosmology.  Our solar system is moving at about 371 km/s relative to the comoving frame, which gives a time dilation factor of only 1.0000008, which is why it doesn't matter much what (reasonable) reference frame we pick.

Is that how heat energy works? Would it stay in the body unless there was sweat to evaporate? Sounds like the information sources I found are leaving out some important detail about how heat energy works cause this explanation does not compute. Anyone care to fill in the missing info?     Releasing the sweat does not have any cooling effect whatsoever. It needs to evaporate. The vast majority of body heat is lost in the form of evaporation energy. A liquid requires a certain threshold energy - enthalpy - to change into its gaseous form. That's where the body heat disappears. While your body also loses heat by other means (heat radiation and simple heat transfer to surrounding materials), evaporation energy lost to sweat evaporation is usually orders of magnitude bigger.",

I'm trying to apply what you told me to make sense of this. According to the book, \"the human body's ability to cool off depends on the air's ability to absorb sweat as it evaporates. If the air cannot absorb your sweat, then it can t cool you off, no matter how much you perspire.\"   Doesn't the fact that the sweat evaporated mean that you have been cooled off?

    "answer": "When a nuclear weapon goes off it releases a huge amount of UV/Xrays/Gamma rays which move outward and smack into electrons of air molecules with enough energy to knock them loose and send the electrons flying.  This huge and sudden current of electrons quickly moving away from the center point creates a suddenly changing magnetic field.  We use this feature in transformers and wireless chargers.  If you change a current it creates a changing magnetic field which can be coupled into a nearby wire to create a current in that wire so you can pass power wirelessly.  For nuclear EMPs \"nearby\" is hundreds of miles away and the changing magnetic field is insanely strong.  The US did a test called [Starfish Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime) where they detonated a nuke about 400 km up(roughly the height of the space station which didn't exist yet).     Starfish Prime ended up creating a field over Hawaii (900 miles away) that was 5600 Volts/meter which means a 10 meter long power line would generate 56,000 volts at the end of it.  This is pretty bad for power lines and blew out a few hundred streetlights, but it was really before the era of microelectronics.  A 5mm long trace in your smart phone would have experienced 28 volts which is pretty devastating to a system expecting to run at less than 5 volts.

    "question": "ELI5: Is it just a coincidence that the color spectrum \"loops\" around?",
    "answer": "The sensation of colour is generated in our brains, as a way to interpret the signals from the cone cells in our eyes. The cone cells come in three different types, sensitive to different wavelength ranges of light. When light of a certain wavelength hits the retina, it stimulates the three different types of cone cells by different amounts. Those different amounts of stimulation are sent to your brain, where you brain assigns a \"colour\" to the combined signal.  As it happens, light of the shortest wavelengths we can detect, around 400 nanometres, our brain interprets as \"violet\", while light of the longest detectable wavelengths (around 750 nm), our brain interprets as \"red\". The fact that red and violet seem to be similar colours that can blend into one another comes from the fact that our brain also needs a way to interpret a *mixture* of wavelengths, some around 400nm plus some around 750nm, with no intermediate wavelengths.  If you have a mixture of 400nm plus 750nm light, your brain gets signals from the short wavelength and long wavelength sensitive cone cells, but *none* from the middle wavelength cone cells. Your brain interprets this as magenta - a colour \"in between\" violet and red. Magenta cannot be generated by a single wavelength of light - it's not in the rainbow.  Your brain needs to be able to move continuously from violet to red via this magenta sensation, to account for different ratios of short+long wavelength light. So your brain considers this to be a continuum of colours fading smoothly into one another.  **In summary:** No, it's not a coincidence. But it's also not an inherent \"fact of nature\" that 400nm light looks \"similar\" to 650nm light. It's a result of the architecture of our eyes and brain.  For example, birds have extra cone cells sensitive to ultraviolet light. To them, 400nm and 750nm light most likely look very different, and the wrapping around in \"colour\" only occurs for the wavelengths around 250nm (in the UV where we can't see) and 750nm.",

Any sound at a frequency that's a simple multiple of the main harmonic (e.g. 2x330=660Hz, 3x330=990Hz etc.) will *also* be repeated.  Most usually, the sound that triggers this kind of feedback is a fairly sharp click noise, such as you get when you plug something in.

Because there are only a couple of \"low\" frequencies that are multiples of that fundamental, and far more at higher frequencies.

    "answer": "It depends very much on the type of gene therapy! The most promising form of gene therapy is based on the CRISPR-Cas9 protein, so I can explain that. Basically, CRISPR-Cas9 (or just CRISPR) is a protein (which is just a particular type of huge, complicated molecule) produced by many kinds of bacteria. There is a particular spot on this giant molecule where fragments of DNA can stick to CRISPR. What CRISPR then does, through a minor miracle of biochemistry, is it will seek out and destroy any DNA sequences which match the \"target\" it has stuck to itself. The key here is that this destruction is very precise - CRISPR will destroy DNA sequences which *exactly* match those stuck to it, no more and no less.  Say, then, you have someone with the gene for cystic fibrosis (CF), and you'd like to replace that gene with a normally-functioning lung gene. What you do is you make a mixture containing CRISPR-Cas9 and many copies of the gene for CF. The genes will stick to the CRISPR, turning the protein into a homing missile against the CF gene. You then inject your patient with 2 things - your CF-targeting CRISPR, and many copies of the normal lung gene you want them to have. Your body has natural mechanisms within its cells to repair damaged DNA, so once the CRISPR has removed the CF genes from the body, the patient's cells will grab the best available DNA to patch the hole left behind - the normal lung genes you gave them. Once the DNA is repaired using the shiny new genes you gave it, the patient is cured!  Of course, there a lot more complications and fiddly bits, but this is the conceptual basis for the treatment. Interestingly, the bacteria that make CRISPR actually use it as part of their immune system! Any time they survive a viral attack, CRISPR will grab a piece of the defeated virus's DNA to efficiently destroy it should it rear its head again. Pretty crazy stuff",

It also shows how, in the past few decades, many of these sources of new generations of record-breaking performances are becoming exhausted.

The only way you will get it as 1 is to type it out in text form as 6\u00f7(2(1+2)). Parentheses ARE the key thing in understanding an equation. It's not ambiguous at all.  Writing it out on a piece of paper like  6  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  2(1+2)  will result in 1, because you ALWAYS do the math of the numerators and denominators first as if they were in parentheses.

    "answer": "The brain does not regenerate, as the neuron cells that make it up do not multiply after a certain age. The remaining cells may create new connections to the surrounding cells, but those connections (called dentrites, who look like tree branches) do not go far.    But function depends on the area that the tumor was located, besides the age of the person. The younger the brain, the easier it makes new connections to repurpose the functions of the lost area, as there are cases of young children having an entire half of the brain removed, with no significant problems to their mental development.",

These aren't wrong, but they don't explain why, in nearly 500 million years of evolution, insects never evolved lungs.  Insects never evolved lungs because natural selection could change the size of insects much, much faster than it could evolve a new organ. So whenever oxygen levels dipped, insect sizes changed to adapt -- and no lungs were needed.  Had there ever been an insect species that needed to be big, **and** to survive one of the many oxygen depleted parts of history, then perhaps we would all be living in a nightmare-fueled world with beetles the size of elephants roaming down the streets.

By using the delay time between a sound reaching our ears in conjunction with the shape of our ears we can establish a direction and distance from the source without ever having to consciously decide to do so.

As a neat aside, we can also hear the difference between hot and cold running water, and how full a vessel is.

    "question": "ELI5: Why are high impedance headphones hard to drive yet low impedance hifi speakers require a more powerful amplifier to get them to perform optimally?",
    "answer": "High impedance headphones are a result of the much thinner wires that make up the voice coils which drive the membrane in order to keep them as light as possible. These extremely thin wires are of much higher resistance because resistance is a function of the cross sectional area of a conductor. Because power is voltage squared divided by resistance you need more voltage to increase the effective output power which is what makes them \"harder\" to drive. If the output circuit isn't compensating the sound will just be much quieter.  Speakers on the other hand are about massive displacement of air. The lower the resistance, the more current, the more power at the same voltage, the more powerful an amplifier you need. So if you go down from 8ohms to 3ohms you've nearly tripled the amount of current those coils can handle so you need almost triple the power so you need a much higher wattage amp to drive the speaker.  In short, high end headphones require more voltage to drive them to compensate for the resistance of smaller wires while high end speakers allow more current due to the lower resistance of the wire.",
    "follow-up": "Aren't headphones also about the displacement of air though just on a much smaller scale compared to speakers? I understand the principle of greater resistance needing more voltage to get the same level output for headphones. I still don't understand why lowering the resistance means more input is needed for speakers though as this seems to be the exact opposite way to how headphones work? Surely 1 volt into headphones with a resistance of 30ohms is going to give a much louder output than headphones with a resistance of 300ohms, so why is it the other way around for speakers and a more powerful amplifier required?  Edit: just to add that I've played around with the calculator linked below to see if I can understand this. My amp is rated at 60w at 8ohms or 120w at 4ohms.   At 8ohms fed by 60 watts we get 2.73A and 21.9V. At 4ohms and 120w we get the same volts, but current has increased to 5.47A, so effectively doubled. A few questions on this then: Is the increase in current the reason why a better quality amp that can handle the higher current is needed at lower resistances even though it should be easier to push the current through and if so, why? Is the power going to the speakers determined by the number of volts being fed into them and in order to keep the voltage up as resistance decreases more current is needed? If I'm correct with both of these then why isn't current an issue with higher resistance headphones, or is it?   https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/electric/watt-volt-amp-calculator.html",

    "question": "ELI5: How does large scale desalination work?",
    "answer": "So essentially, in the ocean and seas, water is constantly evaporating.  When it evaporates, it's mostly salt free, as the salt doesn't go with water vapor.  It turns into clouds as it gathers together, then goes inland and rains.  Man made desalination works similar.  Except accelerated and in a much smaller surface area.  We heat up the water.  That causes it to evaporate quickly, and we collect the water vapor, and get fresh water.    The residue of the man made desalination process is very salty water.  Which gets pumped back into the ocean, and can cause issues with the area it gets pumped into getting too salty and killing off everything.  The limitation is cost.  It takes a huge amount of energy to heat up water to produce enough fresh water to be usable.  That huge amount of energy is very expensive.",

Sometimes the tumors can grow and kill off the cells that form the walls of organs complicating the removal process. If even a single cancerous cell is left behind and not destroyed by the body - it can grow back into another tumor, so it can carry many risks.  Lastly, the most dangerous types of cancer are tumors that actively spread freely throughout the body.

As a result freshwater fish do not have much need to intentionally \"drink\" for the sake of gaining water, it also means their kidneys are always producing  urine which leads to needing to pee.

This means a couple of things 1) Saltwater fish need to intentionally drink a lot water since they are constantly losing their body's water. 2) since they are constantly losing water they have significantly less need to urinate than their freshwater brothers and sisters. 3) comically - saltwater fish are very commonly internally dehydrated...

In general water evaporates from the oceans, forms clouds, rains on the ground, and forms rivers which drain back to the ocean.    We typically suck up huge quantities of water from rivers, and given that weather is somewhat unpredictable and you can have droughts and other adverse weather effects, bottom line the water in that river that feeds several states could dry up.  So planners look at *consumption* and then also at the average amount of rainfall / weather / on average how much of that water may return to that river through natural phenomena.  We can't control the natural phenomena, but we CAN control consumption, so that's why it's measured.",

This could be over the wires used for cable TV, over the phone wires or over a fiber optic cable. There are a few other connection method but they are the common ones. This connection goes to a box in your house called a router (sometimes also called a hub) this is normally supplied by the ISP.  The router is the centre of your houses network, anything using your houses internet connection will connect to this box either using a wired connection or WiFi.  WiFi is a short range radio link between two devices, normally a computer/ phone and a central hub device called an access point. Your router includes one of these access points or in some cases more than one e.g. one for your normal network and one for a guest network.  WiFi is purely a way of getting a computer network connection without a wire, it doesn't do anything that a physical wire between the two points couldn't do (and generally when possible a wire is better).

But as soon as you open the seal, you allow air in and air has oxygen and germs floating around, so the sauce might go bad in a few days.

So there is no or very little surface of contact between tyres and road, so there is little to no grip.

If you are an ant on that 2D surface (like we are, in the 3D volume of the universe) then your perception is that the surface area is finite in size, but it \\*has no edges\\* - in exactly the same way our Universe is finite in size, but has no edges.  Let's say someone takes the ant's balloon, and starts blowing it up even more.   The ant will notice that the surface area is increasing - even though it has no edges.  The ant might ask \"But what is it increasing \\*into\\*?\"   And it's not increasing \\*into\\* anything -- it's just that when you blow a balloon up, the radius increases (let's call this radius \"the metric\") and that causes the surface area of the balloon to increase, too.  That's what's happening to our Universe.  There is a metric, it is increasing, and it causes the finite 3D volume of the universe to increase, without edges to this universe.",

In a sense, yes. The space between any two points is *on average* increasing by a very, very small amount as time goes on. This new space isn't being \"created\" so much as it's just old space being \"stretched,\" like the surface of an inflating balloon or a rubber sheet being pulled from all sides. Bonus fact: On Earth, due to the way mass bends spacetime, we aren't experiencing this in any perceptible way. Gravity is orders of magnitude stronger.

Her handwriting is nicer than mine and my letters look squiggly and ugly compared to hers. Same letters, they just look different. You can make letters on a screen look different, too. That's called a \"font\". Just like different handwriting... same letters that just look a little different. A QR code is really just a weird font. It's handwriting that looks so funny that only a specialist can read it. (Your scanner is the specialist.)  Did you ever notice that QR codes always have three corners that look like plain boxes? That's how the computer knows which side is the top. If you look at a book that's upside down, you know to turn it over before you try to read it. Those boxes tell the computer which way to turn it before it tries to read it.  There's also something called \"error correction\" built in. If I put a dot here for the letter \"c\", then I also put a dot over there to represent that same \"c\". I don't need both dots; I can use either one. But that way, if part of my QR code gets scratched off or dirty, I have a better chance of reading the right message because the clean parts still have enough information.  And finally, there's something called a \"checksum\". A checksum is a small fact about what you just read. For example, I might say \"cat(3)\". That 3 at the end would mean that you should have read a 3-letter word. Or maybe I say \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.(23,12)\" and that means you should have read 23 consonants and 12 vowels. If what you read doesn't match the checksum, then you should try reading it again. A barcode scanner can actually read a barcode multiple times if it has to to get it right.  Quick note: There are many different types of barcodes: UPC, QR, Aztec, Code9. There's a different one on your mail. There's a different one on the sticker on the fruit you buy at the grocery store.

However many of the frontline troops especially in the rank and file like corporals were unaware of how bad the situation was and assumed that Germany could continue fighting and maybe even win the war.

    "answer": "Data is always just a (binary) number. A long string of 1s and 0s  To encrypt it you create a second, random looking number of the same length and then apply the XOR function on both. (Wich basically flips each bit of the original if the corresponding bit of the random number is 1)  So to undo that you need the encrypted data and the same random number. Just apply XOR again to flip the correct bits back.  XOR(A, B) = C -> XOR(C, B) = A  This number isn't truly random. It's generated by an algorithm from a password (or Key). The same key always generates the same random number, but the random number can't be transformed back to the password.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why is the temperature around -150C in space when there's vacuum? What exactly cools if there's just nothing?",
    "answer": "> What exactly cools if there's just nothing?  Welcome to the problem of measuring temperature in space  Temperature is a measure of the thermal energy(there are many types of energy so we only care about thermal here) in a volume.  If item A has a higher temperature than item B then heat goes from A to B.  Since there isn't much stuff in space, the total thermal energy of any volume is stupidly low because 50 hydrogen atoms don't have much heat between them  The problem with space is that it is really low temperature so its not going to put heat into any object in it, but there's nothing around to conduct heat into so heat can only be lost through very slow radiative cooling, basically IR waves wiggling off into space with the energy.  This gives you the weird effect of spacing having an extremely low temperature but also not cooling you off almost at all, both because there's basically nothing",

    "answer": "You are kind of right, saying it is cold in space is not saying much about the experience of being in space since there is nothing to carry or hold onto any temperature. However you do not need anything to transfer thermal energy. Although not as efficient hot things will emit thermal radiation which will heat up objects around it. This is how the heat from the sun is transferred through empty space to Earth and how the heat from a fire can warm you even though the air goes up into the air. And we can measure how much energy comes from each direction and therefore get a temperature of everything. And it turns out the universe is pretty cold. But it will take a long time for someone to cool down to this temperature. Especially if they happen to be around Earth and get hit by the heat emitted from the Earth as well as the hot rays from the Sun.",

    "question": "ELI5 why hand prosthetics are so challenging to create?",
    "answer": "The one of the most important things to think about when designing a prosthetic (after safety) is how you are going to control it. It might initially seem like, \"we have things like bluetooth, so why is this hard?\" but think about where that signal is coming from in the first place. One of the simplest ways we did prosthetics was by coupling it to motion of another joint. For instance, if you raise your shoulder, your hand closes. Lower your shoulder again and it opens. Obviously, this is very mechanical.   For more advanced methods, we can look at the nerves in your arm. There are three main nerves, but each of these give off branches to different muscles, and we aren't skilled enough to directly measure signals going directly to all ~25 muscles in the forearm and hand. One thing we can do, though, is cheat. Instead of looking for a small nerve, we can put a chip in the region of your brain that sends signals to the hand. The problem here is that we still can't pinpoint a signal. We can train you to use it better, but it is like learning to walk all over again... with the extra difficulty of your muscles don't work properly.  So what is the absolute easiest way to deal with all of these problems? Simple - limit the function of the hand. While we can't get each nerve signal, we can measure signals in the larger nerves. Your hand wont have the dexterity of a slight-of-hand artist, but we can restore *some* of the lost function, which is preferable to none.",

    "question": "ELI5: Where do cable, satellite, and other TV providers get the actual TV streams from? How is a live digital TV stream distributed around the world?",
    "answer": "Your TV provider literally points a satellite dish at the appropriate satellite or has a direct digital feed from the transmission suite. When I say direct, they pay internet backbone companies to provide a high speed, multi routed feed between the sites.  As an aside ...  I've been in the transmission suite at the Atlanta studio of CNN international although it was many years ago.  The signal from the studio was piped over to the dish farm next to the Turner \"Mansion\" and transmitted to various satellites from there.  For my work we were using the Intelsat uplink and the corresponding downlink in the UK at Madley. At the downlink it used to then be bounced up to the Astra satellite constellation for Europe.  So while a great deal will have changed since then, the studio signal will still follow a similar path as it did then. The delay from the studio to a TV in Europe was about a second.  The London studio feed was sent to Atlanta in a similar way, but was piped to an uplink in London using a high speed, dedicated connection. These days your home broadband is many times faster than what was used, but even 4k signals aren't that bandwidth hungry really.  The London feed would be mixed in at the studio in Atlanta, so the delay could be a couple of seconds if you were watching a TV in London while standing in the London studio. It was an odd experience.  All the feeds are backed up with alternate systems in case of failure. Although the London studio feed was cut off once when a backhoe dug through both primary and alternate fibres on the route to the uplink. They used another physical route for the alternate feed after that.  Happy days.",
    "follow-up": "Very interesting. So you're saying it's either satellite or dedicated fiber lines (actual dedicated fiber cables, not just guaranteed bandwidth) on Tier 1 networks.  Still impressive that the latency was only 1 second when you consider the signal went from Atlanta to the UK and then to Europe, up and down 2 geostationary satellites.

    "answer": "TV networks send their signal either up to a satellite (by far most common) or directly to the cable company via a fiber network (uncommon, for special cases)  If by satellite, there a ton of communications/tv satellites out there, they just rent space on it. They send the signal up to the satellite and the satellite bounces/broadcasts it back down. The cable company then has their own receivers on the ground that pick up the satellite signal for each channel  If its a fiber, they have a direct feed to the cable/sat company. This is more common for streaming live TV services (like Sling TV), for reasons beyond this ELI5, but satellite is overwhelmingly the most common way its done  Signals are all encoded in fairly complicated ways to make sure its high enough quality, but also not too bandwidth heavy. It will vary a little on each tv network. Usually the raw signal from the tv network is an overly high quality version.  The cable company when they send the customer the tv channel, transcodes everything to the proper format they need to send it to you, which again, will vary by each channel and cable provider, but its compressed and reduced. If you're wondering, top channels, like sports and HBO are the best quality, and they may send lower quality signals of channels that aren't watched much. They is usually only so much bandwidth the cable company has for all its content.",
    "follow-up": "I see. So does the cable TV provider have satellite antennas in each headend or do they get the signal in a few places and then distribute it via their internal network to the smaller headends?  What about satellite TV providers? Do they receive the signal on the ground from the satellite, like the cable TV provider, but then broadcast it again up to another satellite and finally down to their customers? Or does CNN directly stream it to the Dish Network satellite and then they broadcast it to their customers? I guess they couldn't transcode it if they did that, unless the satellite could do transcoding.  And for Internet providers like Sling, you say they get some of their signals from dedicated fiber lines? (or just dedicated bandwidth). Why isn't all content distributed via the Internet on guaranteed bandwidth links?",

    "question": "ELI5: What happens to the radiation absorbed by your body during a chest x-ray?",
    "answer": "Some of it passes right through, some is scattered/re-emitted by interactions with the matter in your body. Of the radiation that is absorbed, most or all of it transfers its energy and momentum into the movement of atoms and electrons. Sometimes an electron is temporarily knocked into a different orbit, and then finds its way back, a little bit of heat is generated, and that's the end of it. But sometimes a chemical bond that held a molecule together, depended on one of those electrons and is disrupted by this. So a molecule can be broken apart, and the separated pieces can become reactive chemicals which want to form new bonds with something else. (edit: or they can reattach to each other, but perhaps in a slightly different shape than before!)  Most of the time when an X-ray strikes a molecule, chemicals aren't broken apart and new ones aren't formed. And most of the time when this does happen, it's one molecule in a pile of zillions of the same molecule, and losing one doesn't make a huge difference. But occasionally it can strike a molecule which is responsible for producing or regulating other molecules - like a piece of DNA or RNA, and *then* little chemical changes in single molecules, can start to make a meaningful difference in your body. The amount absorbed in a few X-ray images is not enough to cause any serious problems. But they really want to minimize how much this happens just the same, and very especially for people who work with the machines every day - which is why the X-ray room has heavy shielding everywhere, lead vests and aprons etc.",

    "question": "ELI5: what is the exact science of how the electrode precipitator machines work that the alkaline water filter companies use to scare you into buying their $8k water filtration system?",
    "answer": "Here's what happens: Chemically pure water doesn't conduct electricity by itself, deionized and distilled water are very poor conductors as well due to the very low electrolyte (mostly salts) concentration. So when you put a pair of electrodes in a cup containing some pure water or deionized water and try to let an electrical current flow, nothing happens. But then again, every day water is not chemically pure nor deionized (and there's no in-home system capable of obtaining that and there's no point in doing that).  If you were to add let's say table salt into the former system, then it would become an electrolytic cell, and chemical reactions would take place into the electrodes; specifically a reduction in the cathode and an oxidation on the anode. This is the point where the scam gets in action: the electrodes in the cell are made from metals, commonly aluminum and copper, copper gets oxidized because of it's reduction potential, therefore forming copper ions in solution.   There are many other reactions that could occur depending on the salts naturally dissolved in water, and all those reactions cross-react with copper ions (and any other harmless ions that might be in drinking water), forming a very chemically-diverse precipitate with a dark foul-color; giving the false idea that the tap water is filthy and unsafe, when in truth the electrodes are to blame.  On a side note, if both electrodes were made from platinum (a very chemically stable metal) you wouldn't see anything but a bubbling indicating water electrolysis into pure hydrogen and oxygen, no foul colors, no anything, because platinum won't oxidize in that setup.  In conclusion, as you already noted it, it's only a ruse to scare people into buying something.",

    "answer": "Iodine is an antiseptic and kills bacteria and viruses. It will have no effect on most chemical contaminants in water, and doesn\u2019t remove anything from the water. It just makes it so germs in the water die before you drink it. Interestingly, exactly why it does this is poorly understood, though it is known that iodine attacks a lot of the chemical compounds that germs need to function.  Iodine does not build up in your body, at least not long term. In fact, iodine is the heaviest element that your body has a use for and you need (very small) amounts of it to live. So some small amount will be incorporated, at least for a bit, into your body and that\u2019s a good thing! If you don\u2019t get enough, you can even get [a disease called \u201ciodine deficiency\u201d](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_deficiency). Most people in the developed world get enough iodine in their diets to prevent this, and iodine is often added to table salt (because that\u2019s a convenient way to keep it) to ensure this.   Drinking a few drops might cause some burns before it dilutes down. I don\u2019t recommend it.  There exist radioactive isotopes of iodine (and all other elements), but they are not found in nature. Nuclear weapons and accidents can release a lot of these radioactive forms of iodine, though. To help prevent the body from taking up this radioactive iodine and using it, it is normal practice to give people who may be exposed to such a thing a fairly large doses of non-radioactive iodine to outcompete the dangerous, radioactive versions of it in your body.",

Wires give off a small magnetic field when electricity runs through them. You can use this magnetic field to basically cause the reverse to happen. So when the generator spins the spools on the spinning part creat a magnetic field. This then causes electricity to start flowing in the spools on the static part of the generator. This is the electricity they use. Please correct me if I'm wrong. It's been a while.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do we stutter even though we know exactly what we want to say?",
    "answer": "It's not my specialist subject at all, but I've read a couple of articles on the subject.  To make words come out of your mouth, there is a part of your brain that takes the \"words you want to say\" messages and controls the parts of your mouth, tongue, breathing and stuff to make the desired sounds come out of your mouth.  There is another part of the brain that deals with hearing and understanding.  That part of the brain takes sounds coming in your ears and identifies word sounds and constructs meaning out of them.  When you actually want to speak, both of these processes are working together.  In your brain you form the sequence of words you want to say, and send them to the \"make words come out of your mouth\" process.  At the same time the \"understanding language\" part of your brain is listening to the actual sounds coming out of your mouth and checking that the sounds it is hearing are a correct representation of what you wanted to say.  If it detects something going wrong, it interrupts the making words process and makes you go back a bit and do it again, but right this time.  For people who stammer, there is a mismatch in this process.  The \"detect a mistake and correct it\" process happens when it doesn't need to happen, and causes a stutter.  Of course once the first stutter happens, there is now a genuine mistake, so the process repeats, and you get caught in a loop of trying to correct the error caused by trying to correct the previous error.  It is well known that people who are prone to stuttering and stammering only do it in certain situations, for example if they are nervous or in certain emotional states, because in those situations, there is a different threshold for error tolerance.  If you are comfortable and with people you trust, your brain just doesn't care as much if it makes a bit of a mistake.  If you can't hear yourself speak, then you can't stammer because it breaks the feedback loop.  If you are singing, then a different process is taking place.  The brain deals with music and language separately.  If you listen to a song, for example, it is very often the case that you just don't follow the meaning of the lyrics because your brain is in \"music\" mode rather than \"language\" mode.  When you sing, the sound feedback is being handled by the music part of the brain, so the hypercorrection from the language part of the brain doesn't cause the undesirable interruptions.",

At the same time, Typhoons in the pacific are getting bigger and more frequent, so there's more water being dumped back into the ocean.

    "question": "ELI5: Can there be a machine that\u2019s an \u201canti-lightbulb\u201d?",
    "answer": "There are two answers to this question: No, because light doesn't work that way; *or* Yes, but it's Complicated.  On the \"no\" side, you have the fact that light, as a form of energy, can neither be created nor destroyed. It just moves around from place to place. (This is called the \"conservation of energy.\" For complicated math reasons, the fact that physics works the same if you \"run\" time forwards or backwards *requires* that energy cannot be destroyed.) So, as others have said, you could use something like a black hole to suck up light, but that's just shunting the light into that space, which isn't really the anti-lightbulb with a darkness aura around it like you are asking for.  On the \"yes\" side, there is a very complex, very difficult way that could *theoretically* work, but it would require much more advanced technology than we possess. This is because light is made of tiny wave-packets, which we call photons. Each photon, theoretically, has a perfect equal and opposite: one with the same amplitude, but exactly reversed peaks and troughs (high and low ponts) in the wave. If these waves meet perfectly, so each high part of one wave is exactly where the corresponding low part of the other wave is, then the effect is cancelled out, and it will be as if there is no photon present at all. Then they will pass by each other and be detectable again. If--and this is a very BIG if--you could make a device that could *exactly* match the incoming photons with its own outgoing photons, you could make an anti-lightbulb that would create a halo of unlit space around itself. This would be very, very difficult however, and we probably do not have computers good enough to calculate which light needs to go where *fast enough* to make one work, even in an extremely rigidly controlled environment.  However, while doing this with *light* is very hard, doing it with *sound* is actually (sort of) possible! As an example, think of being at a concert, where the same sound waves are being sent out of two different speaker units. If those speaker units are positioned correctly, there will be points where the sound waves from one speaker will exactly cancel out the sound waves of the other speaker, meaning a microphone at that point would hear (effectively) silence. The effect is not perfect silence normally, because in the real world, objects have volume, whereas the place where the waves cancel out is (in theory) a single point. But you can absolutely experience these points of silence in the real world! You can also get the exact opposite phenomena, where sound gets reinforced to become louder than it would be otherwise, because the two waves *stack* their high parts right on top of each other (same for the low parts).  The formal physics term for waves that cancel out is \"destructive interference\" (the two waves combine to make a \"weaker\" wave), and for waves that amplify it's called \"constructive interference\" (the two waves combine to make a \"stronger\" wave).",
    "follow-up": "I doubt a device capable of destructive interference of incoming light could ever exist, honestly. You'd need a device that could either detect incoming light and respond to it *faster* than light, or you'd need a completely rigid environment as you stated with an algorithm that could somehow calculate the path of every single incoming lightwave *before* it's emitted that would also calculate how long the emission would last, and I feel like the only computer that could ever process that amount of data would have to be a theoretical processor that doesn't generate any heat, otherwise it's just not feasible to perform that many mathematical calculations without generating enough heat to...I dunno, trigger fusion.   That's before we even get into how absurdly precise the device emitting the...anti-light? would have to be and how quickly it would need to be able to adjust.",

I don't know if that quite counts as the bulb repelling light. The bulb \"tells\" the entangled particles what to do, and that \"what to do\" is \"pull [get] these photons away from me,\" so maybe?  Fundamentally I think the problem is that darkness is the absence of light, and light isn't the absence of darkness (except experientially). It's very much like conceiving of the hot and the cold. The cold just is an absence of heat (particles moving), so those problems and solutions don't have the kind of symmetry that we might like them to have.

You could see plenty of pixels on the screen and most of the texture/models were made with it in mind. You had plenty of sharp corners, and bare bone texture because the low resolution would also provide an aesthetic. These sharp edges/corners would have a black edge usually, and with the low resolution, this would help slightly blur the sides. You wouldn't see sharp as much which gave a better look.  For images though, it meant that past a certain distances you didn't have enough pixels to properly render the entire texture. You'd have blobs of colors that were difficult to make sense of.  With higher resolution, you have many more pixels to work with. suddenly the black line don't hide the edges, but on the other hand you have enough to render that entire far away texture.  Of course, in some game this does nothing. If your texture is made at low pixel count to begin with, you'll still only see a few pixels.",
    "follow-up": "So basically, most of the time original models and textures are high res, but for consoles to handle the games they are rendered in a lower resolution?

Humans have larger brains than other apes and so our snouts are less pronounced than chimpanzees; a typical human skull was also maybe 8in long at the toothline, but closer to 7in at the eyeline.  I say \"was\" because the human jaw doesn't grow correctly unless children are given solid foods to chew.  The reliance on cereals (oatmeal, rice, flour, etc.) as a calorie source, and to a lesser extent the invention of baby food to prevent choking deaths, has resulted in almost everyone--at least in rich Western countries--having severely deformed faces.  (For example, I grew up in a middle-class family in the United States and so my forehead is directly above my teeth: my head is about 7in long at the eyeline--normal human size--but also 7in at the toothline.  98% of the people I meet are the same: flat-muzzled.

    "answer": "Your whole body actually prefers to sleep a bit cold. Studies have shown that keeping your thermostat at about 65 degrees Fahrenheit is optimal for the deepest sleep. Also, apparently keeping a cool head allows your body to expel heat more effectively (understandably). Since keeping your body warm takes energy and sort of defeats the purpose of sleep (that being to rest), we can imagine why we want to expel this heat. The body temperature we keep while awake is such because our chemical reactions and electrical signals in our body happen most efficiently at these temperatures. We don\u2019t really need to be think and act while asleep, so this conservation of energy while resting makes sense.   So body saves energy and rests easier by being a bit colder. Keeping a cool head is important to expel heat.    Aome anecdotal notes: Actually, for me I quite like my body at the same temperature as my head, it just makes me feel safe and relaxed to be covered, so I continue to sleep with a blanket. Additionally, my hands and feet are often *colder* than my head, so I also sometimes use my blanket to warm them up to the comfortable temperature my head is at, not past it to be warmer.     My really quickly gathered sources I\u2019m not an expert I just made a quick google search to back up my ideas:  https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/best-temperature-for-sleep  https://rem-fit.co.uk/blog/why-do-you-prefer-the-cold-side-of-the-pillow",

    "answer": "DC is basically more usable power, as it is continuous: Current flows from the negative pole of a battery, to the positive post of that battery (or whatever parallel/series configuration it has). This means that internal parts don't have to adjust individually, and to boot, it is highly easy to transform AC into DC, via the use of diodes/resistors and often capacitors to deal with the drop in power that comes from the AC source.  AC is easier to transport across large distance, as it basically loses less strength (Voltage) over longer cabling. Even great conductors like copper have some resistance, so that particularity of AC is important. It is also used by most appliances that don't necessarily ***need*** DC, such as refrigerators, or dryers.  Basically you want DC when you need efficiency, you want AC when you want distance, but this is am excessively dumbed down version.  Now, back to your question about your fridge: I strongly recommend against having a 110V plug for a 12V compatible appliance, because you're basically going to break it entirely.",

There are simply more transactions, more value in goods in labour around. You need more cash to cover that. But with a fixed gold supply, you can't make that adjustment.

If you remember, Jay-Z took his catalogue off Spotify and hosted it exclusively on Tidal. Drake had his albums exclusive to Apple Music for a timeframe. This was the norm because artists were being cut massive cheques. The result of all this was we saw these albums get disproportionately pirated by users of platforms that the albums weren\u2019t exclusive too. So the execs at the big 3 decided platform exclusives were over.   We still don\u2019t have a concrete reason why platform exclusivity leads to higher rates of piracy in music when the same isn\u2019t true of podcasting or video.

Most money in modern banking system is electronic - it only exists as numbers in a computer. No country prints out paper money equivalent of the money available in their economy.  So there is no real issue to resolve here and, no, banks don't need to cart around pieces of paper from location to location. Bank A simply electronically transfers funds to Bank B and vice versa, as required.   Banks do loan each other money though. The reasons for that are more complicated generally. Banks are required (by law) to maintain a certain money \"reserve\" in their accounts at the Central Bank in accordance with their deposits and loans. At certain times, banks may require more reserves and some banks have excess reserves of money. They will borrow from each other usually for very short periods (like overnight) just to maintain the required amounts.",

    "question": "Eli5 How does sun screen work?",
    "answer": "Let's start with \"what causes a sunburn?\".  Your skin gets hit with sunlight and you see the bright sunlight hitting it. But that bright sunlight isn't what causes the damage.  What you don't see is the types of sunlight that our eyes can't pick up on. One of these types of light that we can't see is ultra-violet, and it has a fair amount of energy in it. So when it hits your skin and you don't have any protection, over time, that energy kinda wrecks important and complex stuff that makes up your cells  (in sort of the same way a fire that's too close burns your skin). The ultraviolet light damages the cells that make up your living skin, and causes them to turn red or blister or peel.  Sunscreen is like a wall that doesn't let quite as much of that invisible, damaging light through. Apply it and it dries into a sort of invisible armor that our eyes can't see... but that ultraviolet light (which our eyes also can't see) can't get through. So our skin doesn't get as damaged, and we don't get \"burned\".",

To get the texture and taste of chocolate just right, you really have to dial in the proportions of these ingredients.   So if you want to remove the sugar, you're going to have to replace it with something else. The usual way is to increase the content of cocoa solids to replace sugar, which will result in a harder and darker chocolate.

That's what they are set up for: VHF broadcast reception within several predefined channels.  When the first home video devices were invented (VCRs, computers, video games, etc) the only way for your television to recognize the signal was if the device in question created a signal identical to what the broadcast station would create.  Conveniently, most televisions had the ability to connect an external antenna in the back. All your device had to do was convert the desired composite video into an NTSC broadcast signal with appropriate levels, and feed it into an antenna cable, which you wired directly to your television.  The last step is telling your television where to find the signal. Most devices broadcast on either channel 3 or channel 4, and there was usually a switch on the back to choose.",

    "answer": "Given the large break in between seasons, it is highly unlikely that any filming for a future season will be going while at the same time filming for a current season. For a TV Show, you're almost certainly only ever filming one episode at a time, as you have production schedules to meet and a single episode requires weeks of production around it.  Continuity is maintained simply by paying attention to it and hiring staff to enforce it. The producers and writers will typically come up with what is known as a \"show bible.\" It's like the written wiki for that show, updated and maintained as the show progresses. That covers continuity at a larger level.  Episode-to-episode is usually because you have a somewhat static pool of writers. They develop a collective tone and continuity over the series, which is why many series can change drastically if they writers change.  Lastly, in scene-to-scene you have specific staff members whose job it is to make sure things look the same from shot to shot (since not all shots are done in show order) so that continuity is maintained.",

Any single one of them is not all that useful. However the combination of these various bits of information can narrow it down quite a bit.

    "answer": "There is a central bank in America called the Federal Reserve (the Fed); the Fed has one lever it can pull to slow down or speed up the economy and its raising or lowering interest rates.  When the economy is doing well and jobs are abundant, it raises interest rates to encourage people to save money, when it's slow it lowers interest rates to encourage people to borrow money.  The Fed lends money to banks when in turn lends money to consumers.  When a person walks into a bank and borrows $1,000,000 to build a new factory $1,000,000 is added to the economy.  Part of that $1M might go to pay the wages of a construction worker that now has a steady job to take out a $270k loan for a new house, so now $270,000 just got added to the original $1M.  The Fed tries to target the rate of inflation at around 2%.  You want to encourage people to spend money; if money were getting more and more valuable every day and prices were steadily dropping, the economy would drastically slow down.  The money you  borrow today would be paid off tomorrow in more expensive dollars; why would you buy a house today for $300,000 when you can buy it next year for $275?  Inflation happens because the ratio of money circulating in the economy increases faster than the amount of goods and services being produced.  In the case of the inflation we're seeing now, COVID-19 caused the amount of goods and services being produced to drastically decrease, but people still demanded those goods and services because most world governments sent their citizens money to prevent the economy from collapsing.",

    "answer": "I\u2019ve conducted a study on this in my back yard for several years. A dead deer from a car accident ends up on our land almost every Fall. It is difficult to get the deer removed, so we are required to bury it. One year, the ground was frozen, so I dragged the poor deer into a field and put a trailcam on it.   Coyotes, foxes, owls, vultures, raccoons, opossums, and other deer visited the corpse. By Spring, the only thing visible was a patch of taller, greener grass.   I did the same experiment the next year and got the same results. Gone by Spring.   I found a deer skeleton in the woods this Spring and I was really surprised. I studied the beetles on it and it was about 6 months old. It was in a strange position and the head was missing. My neighbor threw the skeleton of the deer he butchered in the woods.

    "question": "ELI5: Why does time slow down at high speeds?",
    "answer": "The bending of spacetime refers to the slowing of time caused by gravity. \"Spacetime,\" in turn, refers to the fusion of the three dimensions of space that we're familiar with -- length, width, and depth -- and the one dimension of time. The \"dimension\" of something refers to how many pieces of information you need to locate something within a space. You need those four values to precisely identify where and when something is, and so spacetime is (classically, at least) four-dimensional.  The reason time slows down at high speeds is more complicated than it appears on the surface: light *always* travels at the speed of light. The thing is, I really do mean **always** -- no matter how fast you're moving, you will always measure light to be moving away from you at one single speed.  >\"But, what if you're moving forward at one-quarter the speed of light and turn on a flashlight? If you're moving at quarter lightspeed, and turn on a flashlight which travels *at* lightspeed, wouldn't you measure the beam of light to be traveling at the remaining 75%?\"  No, you actually wouldn't. That's the thing: a clock that you carry on you will measure \"correct\" time, but a distant clock will appear to slow down, and it will slow down exactly as much as it needs to so that you measure your flashlight's beam to be traveling exactly at lightspeed.  If you don't think you understand it, that's fine; the *theory of relativity* is very hard to grasp, especially if this is the first you're hearing about it.",

He imagined that if you moved away from the clock at the speed of light, and it says 12:01, it'll keep saying the same time as long as you're moving at the speed of light (you basically \"froze time\"), and that's because the light that's traveling to hit your eye pupils to tell you it's 12 o'clock is at the same speed as you're going. So 12:02 won't happen unless you started to slow down.  Edit: Punctuation.",

    "answer": "Not so much answering your question, but adding/responding to to a number of other comments I\u2019ve read in the thread  First: On the basis of historical robustness - meaning how well it\u2019s accuracy could survive over the years, I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s about as reliable as any other ancient text, theistic or secular.  There are tons of historical accounts from authors of Greek, Roman, and other origins that are our only insights to history that we work off of, despite knowing that they\u2019re often biased, come from a limited perspective, are imperfectly translated, and are usually dramatized.  Yet when it comes to the Bible, people are very quick to criticize it for the same problems. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me.  Second: I do think there needs to be more to someone\u2019s faith than just what they read in the Bible. It gives us insight to God\u2019s heart, and some guidance/instruction to carry on our way, but it can\u2019t be everything.  If we as Christians believe the Gospel, then we also have to believe God is still active and moving today. We have to live out our faith, and experiencing all that comes with it through our lives.  As a side note to that, I think that might be why some people struggle to understand Christianity. They view us as being entirely rooted to these events from 2000 years ago. What\u2019s missed is that our faith is rooted in *our* experiences. However, many \u201cChristians\u201d don\u2019t live their lives that way, so it isn\u2019t seen, and it\u2019s just not apparent to others.",

You're right, in some ways though. People do interpret the Bible to fit their own agendas. Take the saying \"Only God can judge me.\" In my eyes, this is a mantra for people to use to just be themselves and not have self-esteem issues.

If the bullet had a lot of energy going out of the barrel, it now has none. What it has, though, is height, and it is still being accelerated by gravity! Since the friction is zero at this point, the bullet will simply fall and gain speed.  Going down, as its speed increases, so will the friction : at some point the friction will be so strong that the bullet won't accelerate due to gravity anymore: it will have reached its terminal velocity.

    "answer": ">I get that they're really heavy, but don't they have giant muscles to counter that?  First off, no, they don't.   This is due to something called the square-cube law. The strength of your muscles is roughly proportional to their cross-sectional area, which grows with the square of your height (assuming proportional growth), but the mass of those same muscles is proportional to their volume, which grows with the cube of your height (again assuming proportional scaling).   But that's not why giant beings seem to move more slowly.   >For instance, if I want to slam my hand down on the table I can do it in less than a second. Based on their depictions it feels like it would take far longer for one of these giants to do that. How come?  They're giant. The distance from their shoulder to the (giant) table is further than the distance from your shoulder to a normal sized table.   They need to move further, so even if they're able to move/accelerate their hand at the same speed you are (which would be unrealistic due to the square-cube law) it would take them longer to cover the distance, because the distance is greater.",

This is usually a result of the sheerer not being carefull enough and doing many mistakes, possibly because they are working too fast. Depending on the animal wellfare legislation this may be illegal.  The combs are pointy because they need to go through the thick wool easily. If the combs are sharp then they will get stuck in the wool instead of seperating it. When the combs get stuck it is much easier to cause wounds to the sheep either by ripping out pieces of wool while the skin is still attached or by loosing control of the sheers and pushing them into the skin. So in order to avoid this the combs are kept sharp to go thorugh the wool without effort and with full control.

    "answer": "Like you said, it's betting, it's gambling. You basically find someone who disagree with you on the probable outcome of some event so much that they are ready to put some money on the line.  At some point, they are so certain of themselves that they will agree to give you more money if they are wrong than you will give them of they are right. Y'all write a contract stipulating that.  As the event gets closer, if you change your mind, you can try to find someone else to buy the bet from you. If you made a truly bad bet, you might end up selling the contract for a negative value. Example: you bet 100$ at 3:1, you will pay 100$ if you lose, but get 300$ if you win. As time goes by, it seems doubtful to you that you will win. You can offer to sell the bet for -50$, meaning you give 50$ in addition to the bet. For you, you end up eating only a 50$ loss instead of 100$, so that's a better position. For the person buying the bet, they essentially end up with a 50$ at 7:1 bet. Since they will pay 100$ if they lose, minutes the 50$ you gave them (50$ total), and they will get 300$ if they win, plus the 50$ you gave them (350$ total).

    "question": "Eli5: what is modern slavery? How prevalent is it?",
    "answer": "Most people assume that their lives are far removed from slavery \u2013 that it doesn\u2019t happen in the United States, or at least not in our neighborhoods. Nothing could be further from the truth. Between 14,500 \u2013 17,500 victims are trafficked into the United States each year.  It is not only possible, but highly probable, that human trafficking exists in your own community. In December 2018, a Seal Beach, California man was brought before federal jurors on charges of trafficking hundreds of women from Thailand to California, and forcing them to have sex with numerous men each day to pay off \u201cdebts\u201d for their travel costs to the U.S. Human trafficking victims are not only foreign born individuals, either.   In August 2018, a Connecticut man plead guilty to leading a trafficking ring that sold young men for sex. Some of these boys came from moderately affluent homes, but had become addicted to drugs and turned to the sex trade in exchange for drug money. Some of them were disabled. In fact, the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2012 Trafficking in Persons Report noted that people with disabilities are one of the groups most at risk of human trafficking.  Also, sex trafficking is not the only type of human trafficking: forced labor is prevalent in many industries, including sweatshops, agriculture, restaurants, hotels, and domestic service. Between 2011 and 2014, the owner of a Thai restaurant in Oregon fraudulently obtained visas for cooks from Thailand, whom he then forced to work 12 hours a day, six to seven days a week, at minimal pay \u2014exaggerating their debt to him and holding their passports and work visas.  Another dangerous myth many believe is that a victim of human trafficking would reach out for help. The fact is that most trafficking victims fear coming forward, because most are not in possession of their identification documents, and many live under constant threat of violence, either to themselves or to their families.  It\u2019s also important to know the difference between human smuggling and human trafficking. Smuggling involves transporting people illegally across international borders \u2013 this may or may not be consensual, or involve abuse or exploitation. Human trafficking is based on exploitation and is entirely non-consensual.  Statistics A $32 billion-a-year industry, human trafficking is now bigger than the illegal arms trade. In America, it reaches all 50 states and is on the rise: it is projected to surpass the illegal sale of drugs in the next few years.  The International Labour Organization (ILO) is a United Nations agency that sets labor standards, policies and programs for employers and workers of 187 countries, including the U.S. The ILO estimates that around 40.3 million people are trapped in modern-day slavery: that\u2019s 5.4 victims for every 1,000 people in the world.\u00a0 Of these: * 75% of human trafficking victims are 18 or older, and 25% are children. * 71% are female and 29% are male. * 24.9 million victims of modern slavery are exploited for labor. * 16 million (64%) forced labor victims work in domestic work, construction or agriculture. * Debt bondage, a method used to control trafficking victims, affects 50% of victims of forced labor in the private sector.  Possibly the most frightening statistics are about the role of human trafficking in the commercial sex industry. While this does affect male victims, women and girls account for 99% of victims exploited for sex. Around 300,000 Americans under 18 are lured into the commercial sex trade every year. The average victim is a girl between 11 and 14. She will probably die between the age of 18-21, either from a violent physical attack; from HIV and other STDs, malnutrition, overdose or suicide.  Human Trafficking Prevention: What You Can Do There are a number of ways the average person can help to prevent and combat human trafficking: 1. Learn the indicators of human trafficking. The Department of Homeland Security offers Human Trafficking Awareness Training to help rescue victims. If you know the signs, you may be able to save someone, as this airport customer service agent did. Examples of indicators include: * Does the person live with their employer, or in a space owned by their employer? * Are there many people living in a small space? * Does their employer hold their identification documents? * Are they unpaid or paid less than a legal wage? * Are they working to pay off a debt to their employer? * Do they control their own money? * Does the person work extremely long hours without pay? * Is the person unable to speak to you alone, or act as if they are controlled by someone else? * Do they avoid eye contact and social interaction, or does their conversation seem scripted or rehearsed? * Does the person seem overly-submissive or fearful? * Are there signs the person is being physically abused, or is malnourished? * Is the person under 18 and away from his or her parents, or engaged in prostitution? * Are there underage girls or boys who appear malnourished or in poor physical health traveling/checking in to a hotel with adults? Are they traveling with few possessions?  2. Report suspected trafficking * If you are a victim of human trafficking, or you suspect that someone is, contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline: 1-888-373-7888 or text HELP or INFO to BeFree (233733). * Don\u2019t try to confront anyone yourself. Collect as much information as you can without alerting either the victim or the suspect and call the number above. Or, if it is clear that a law is being broken, call local 911.  3. Be a conscientious consumer * Find your slavery footprint: be aware of where and how the products you purchase are made. * Buy more fair trade products and avoid products from companies known to use slave labor. * Reduce and reuse: Instead of purchasing cheaper items more often (many of which are products of forced/child labor), invest in higher-quality items that last longer. Sometimes a second-hand item of higher quality is a better buy than a brand-new item that is cheaply made.  4. Raise awareness; get involved * Educate yourself on human trafficking by watching any of the following videos:     * Journey to Freedom     * The Price of Sex     * Food Chains     * These videos on the DHS website * Support efforts by governmental authorities and organizations committed to ending human trafficking. Spread the word about them, donate to them, or get involved with them:     * Free the Slaves     * National Center for Missing and Exploited Children     * Polaris Project     * Safe Horizon * Find a local organization to support: https://humantraffickinghotline.org/training-resources/referral-directory",

    "answer": "If the surface water is contaminated, it's highly likely that the groundwater will also be contaminated; water can seep through the ground, carrying whatever contaminants with it.  Water purification is a lot more complex than water access is. A purification plant will necessary generate waste (whatever contaminant that needs to be removed). Improper storage/processing of the waste risks leaks, which can cause further groundwater contamination. While this won't affect the people who have access to the purified water, it will certainly impact those downstream who don't have access to purified water.  So whatever solution is devised will require either continuous external funding (which most charities will balk at, since they'd basically be signing up to be a utility company) or a self-sustaining local economy (which is hard to develop, either due to little existing economic activity to build off of or geopolitical instability that makes the area unappealing for investment).",

I have been in their collection centers and rent payroll and equipment is not that much.",

As a patient here's what you're paying for for it:  Serological testing to make sure that it's free of HIV, Syphilis, T. Cruzi, HBV, HCV, HAV, and numerous other agents.  Blood bank testing to ensure complete accuracy that that unit is for sure a specific blood type (and in some cases that unit will be processed for further antigens which can get really pricey REALLY fast. I'm talking like $60-70 a drop of reagent). Need it irradiated or leukocyte reduced? That's more processing that needs to be done.  Processing of the unit in a safe clean environment to make sure the unit is properly separated with all the cellular components intact.  Paying for the transport of the unit through a courier that will ensure the unit is kept in a strict temperature range for storage.  Paying for the medical lab personnel to test the unit again, test your own blood to ensure compatibility, and to issue the unit.  Paying for the nursing staff to physically administer the unit to you and make sure you dont have a transfusion reaction.   Needless to say there's many other things that get factored into the price of the unit, and oh boy do some of those units get VERY pricey. But that's a veeeeery general breakdown. While equipment and payroll themselves may not be very expensive for the blood collection center you've been in, there's tons of moving parts to ensure that you get a safe blood product. And once you're in the lab itself the payroll and equipment gets significantly higher as you're paying for years and years of education and training in that staff.

    "answer": "To take your game level analogy you can calculate the probability of getting through a level by dividing the level into different encounters and count the number of times you are able to get through each encounter. For the last encounters you either have to use practice runs using save states to skip the first encounters or make estimates based on other similar encounters. When you know the probability of getting through each encounter you can calculate the probability of getting through the entire level.  And it is possible to do similar things for conspiracies. In order for a conspiracy to fail we need to know a few things. Firstly we need to know how the conspiracy works, we have to know who is in it and we need to prove all this and be able to convict them. There are a number of conspiracies which only fulfills one or two of these and are therefore successful. We can still study these and figure out what made them work and what in them did not work.",

And I can even appreciate taking the approach _if we use a ridiculously low probability of failure, we can still see that the probability of failure is expected in a short period of time_. But I still feel like they use both a biased and tiny sample.

    "question": "eli5. How come if you pinch your skin it doesnt hurt, but a very small cut can cause a lot of pain?",
    "answer": "As others have noted, your brain cancels out signals from things you did, so pinching yourself is dampened.  However, pain receptors also have very interesting design.  Sharp pains are sharp, because the receptors feedback to turn themselves off.  This is useful so that intense feedback can be given quickly\u2014but not forever.  Lasting injuries activate a different part, which take time to build up a signal, but don\u2019t shut off until healed.  This is useful to ensure that long term care is given to ongoing injury.  This dull pain can be pretty manageable for small injuries, but overwhelming for large ones.  Both are connected though.  The short term receptors block both their own and the long term signals.  This is why if you scratch at a wound you feel relief.  The sharp receptors activate then turn off both signals.  The dull receptors need to re-accumulate stimulus before they have enough to start notifying back to the brain.  Better eli5:  your pain receptors are like two children, named Sharp and Dull.  When Sharp is sad, he shrieks loud and immediately, but that satisfies him and he mellows out.  When Dull is sad, he remains mellow for a while, but the sadness gets to him and he starts crying louder and louder until the sadness goes away.  However, if Sharp shrieks, that distracts Dull and he forgets what he was sad about for a while.  Slowly though, he remembers again until the thing making him sad goes away.",

    "answer": "It's to do with the speed of light.  All observers no matter their frame of reference will measure the speed of light as the speed of light.  No plus or minus their own velocity, etc.    As an analogy.  Say you're standing still by a road and a car wizzes by you at 60 (doesn't matter whether kms, miles, whatever).  You see that car as going 60.  Someone else in a car going 30 in the same direction will see that car as going 30 compared to them.  With light every observer sees the light going the speed of light compared to themselves.  Doesn't change depending on their own velocity, how much gravity they're in, etc.  For this to happen the rate of time for each observer is running differently so the speed of light is always the speed of light.",

If something would be fixed in place, it would travel at lightspeed through time (maximum aging) If something travels at the speed of light through space it would not move through time at all and wouldn't age.

(even though it is usually connected with the neutral) It goes into the ground connector to form a solid connection with the earth.   The diffirence between the neutral and the ground is that the neutral goes back to the source where the electricity is created. Thus, the powerplants generator. Whereas the ground literally goes to a big rod inserted into the Earth.   The point of the Ground wire, besides to prevent against electrocution if metal objects get energised because of a fault, like you correctly said, is actually to act as a common refference and equalising point for all electrical systems and measurements.  Ground is basically the closest thing we have as a \"zero\" for electrical potential, so it's very useful for measuring with. It's also important for our safety that our electrical systems are equalised with ground, because it's the closest to the electrical potential that us humans are at, because we're always standing on it.   It also helps prevent against interferance or issues when you connect two circuits with their own powersource together. Because electrical potential is a very local thing. So two independent isolated battery powered circuits that are both reading 24 volts across their poles, might actually have two entirely diffirent amounts of electrical potential when compared to eachother. So by connecting them both to ground you create a sort of soft electrical connection between the two circuits that equalises them to one another so they'll play nice together, without the chance of interferance or damage.",

    "answer": "The two ions you list aren't stable on their own, they need counter ions. You can't buy a bottle of ammonium or sulfate. You will only get those where there is another molecule they can react with that produces a lower energy situation with a positive ion balanced with a negative one (or more).  So fill a container with ammonia gas and that's wheat it will remain. Introduce an equal number of water molecules and the water loses a proton to the ammonia forming hydroxide and an ammonium ions of equal and opposite charge. An equilibrium will be set up between molecular and ionic forms. NH3 + H2O <=> NH4^+ + OH^-  Similarly SO3 + H2O => 2H+ + SO4^2- although the affinity of sulfur trioxide for water is such that the reverse reaction won't happen because it takes too much energy. You will get the same sort of reactions with other molecules capable of giving up a proton to ammonia (e.g. HCl) or forming salts with acids.  Sulfur dioxide is just one of many oxides of sulfur, but is the lowest energy one when for instance you burn sulfur. You can make the trioxide on the way to manufacturing sulfuric acid but it takes heat energy and a catalyst to oxidize the dioxide. Other oxides known to exist are S2O, SO, and various others because you can replace an oxygen with a sulfur in ion structures like sulfate. So an S surrounded by three oxygens and a sulfur instead of four oxygen atoms gives the thiosulfate ion used in photography as a fixer.  BTW the official IUPAC name is now sulfur, the \"ph\" for the \"f\" sound is regarded as false linguistically as the name doesn't come from Greek.",

When they get cold, they cuddle together to try and stay warmer.  When they are too hot, they get bored and fly up north to try and cool down.

They just need the right motivation to be in a different phase.  Back to laundry. So we now understand that these water molecules soaking our clothes are happy to be there. It's just right out. So we can motivate our molecules to go away by increasing the temperature.   It doesn't matter whether the object gets wet or not. Water is always trying to make the temperature *just right* by either cuddling together and waiting it out. Or just flying away until it's time to play!

It\u2019s a myth that\u2019s spread everywhere because it\u2019s so compelling; it\u2019s one of those explanations that just clicks and makes sense. But it\u2019s not supported by the science. The real drivers of muscle growth are mechanical tension and metabolic stress. Mechanical tension is basically your muscles freaking out over how heavy a weight feels, and deciding to get stronger so that it feels less heavy. Metabolic stress is your body trying to feed energy into your muscles and not being able to keep up with the demand, and deciding to level up the muscles so they need less metabolic support.  Edit: in response to people taking issue with \u201cmyth\u201d - the popular meme \u201cwhy does muscle grow from weight lifting? Cause they get damaged and grow back stronger/bigger\u201d is ABSOLUTELY a myth. The best opposing case that could be made is that muscle damage is one of the three primary drivers of muscle growth, but every expert I\u2019ve read has implied that research over the past decade or so has been building a case that muscle damage is merely correlated with muscle growth under many circumstances.

    "answer": "TLDR: Filling seats costs money, and call flows vary throughout the day.  The call center I worked at had a contract that was for 80% handle time within 5 minutes. That means that 80% of calls had to be answered within 5 minutes. This sounds like a lot, but that translates to just under 5 hours of insane queueing every day. Most of the 80% quota was filled on the overnight shift when we had few calls.  Part of the science and statistics of running a call center is understanding when you can expect certain amounts of call volume and staffing accordingly.  It's all about using the minimum number of staff to run the facility effectively.  They also know how long people are willing to wait on hold so they can tolerate a certain amount of calls in queue. One hour the queue will be high, and the next hour there won't be any queue. So why pay to have seats filled for staff that do nothing for most of the day?  It's better to fill the seats expecting average/predicted handle times and tolerate a queue during the busiest periods.  Did I mention outsourced call centers have a tendency to treat their staff like cattle?",

    "question": "[ELI5] If I put a small pieces of cubed shaped ice in a cup and fill it up with water right to the very edge of the cup why does the cup not overflow once all of the ice has melted?",
    "answer": "Because of how buoyancy (floating) works...the ice cube displaces exactly enough water to equal it's own weight. There's an \"ice cubed shaped hole\" in the water...the weight of the \"hole\" if it filled in with water is exactly the weight of the ice cube. Since ice is less dense than water, the volume of that hole is less than the volume of the ice and the \"extra\" ice pokes up above the water.  So we have a \"hole\" in the water currently filled by an ice cube that's a bit bigger than the hole (the extra ice is above the water surface). Now the ice cube melts...it turns back to liquid water and gets denser, hence smaller. How much smaller? It ends up being \\*exactly\\* the size of the \"hole\" we started with. So it doesn't overflow the glass because the space gained in the glass by the ice melting is exactly the same size as the ice once it melts back to water...the water level in the glass doesn't change.",

    "answer": "When you fill a cup to the brim with ice already inside, the solid chunks of ice are already contributing to the water level. Take the ice out, and you\u2019d have room to add more water. When the ice melts, yes it will add that new water to the level of the cup, but it also takes away the volume that the solid ice chunks took up. When water freezes (ice), it expands, so ice actually takes up more room than the same amount of water would.  TLDR: Ice takes up more space than the same amount of water. Full cup with solid ice will be higher water level than full cup with melted ice.",

That's how heat can travel from the Sun to the Earth without a medium between the two.   Losing heat through radiation alone is slower than by the other methods, so objects in space cool more slowly, but they do cool eventually. The thing you occasionally see in sci fi where people flash freeze in a vacuum is a myth.",

Some come from using something called the \"distance ladder\" where we measure different objects at different distances and can calibrate our rulers from that.

Others come from using the \"CMB\" or Cosmic Microwave Background, where we take some information we have from that early universe and can translate that into a value for the expansion of the universe. These give smaller values.  It's unclear why they are different at this moment. It's only been in the last 5-10 years that we were able to be precise enough to know that they were different in the first place. Before that, we've been able to just ignore it. This is *the question* in modern Cosmology. Some people believe that it's coming from issues with our measurements of the CMB temperature, but it's not certain yet.

Each frat or sorority has it's own little culture and secrets.   I went to a pretty big college, though were were more known for our academics than our frats + sororities. Frats are often huge in US colleges that are known for partying and social life. In my college, the frat + sorority culture wasn't that serious and I didn't bother w/ them.

But how do you prove that for n>2 there are no integer solutions?  You could try brute forcing it but what if it works out when n=51,437?  You'd have to try literally every combination of numbers which is, by definition, infinite  Its problems like these that you can't just set a computer to and crush through the numbers, you have to fall back onto the basic properties of math and other postulates and theorems to show that there is no way that any n>2 results in a, b, and c all being integers.

    "question": "eli5:How does sugar contribute to developing diabetes?",
    "answer": "Until someone comes with more energy to get into detail, real brief & pre-k:  Sugar (glucose is the simplest form, and the most rapidly absorbed)* hitting your bloodstream causes insulin release, a hormone made by your pancreas.  Insulin acts as the key to help glucose get into cells (they need it for energy, extra is stored for later).  If a lot of glucose hits your blood suddenly, a lot of insulin has to be released too.  But if insulin keeps pestering the cells too much, they eventually get insensitive to it, and they need more insulin to open the same amount of doors.  So whereas, before, say you needed 10 insulin for 10 glucose (made up #s) now you need 100 insulin for 10 glucose and so on, it worsens.  Your pancreas too keeps having to put out more insulin, eventually it tires out.  So at some point your cells just aren\u2019t responding to the amount of insulin you produce, there\u2019s not enough insulin to remove all that glucose from your blood, and you\u2019ve got high blood glucose (which damages organs/tissues).  You\u2019ll need drugs either to help your pancreas release/produce more insulin, or straight up need insulin injections.  *Simple sugars are bad bc they\u2019re already glucose/almost glucose.  So 50g of skittles hit your blood as glucose faster than 50g of a more complex carb which will take longer to get broken down to glucose and will thus give your pancreas more time to trickle out insulin, and your cells more time to welcome a trickle of insulin rather than a sudden onslaught, making them less likely to get intolerant.  You\u2019ll also have less glucose floating freely in your blood, causing mischief.  *Edit:* Also yeah, as someone else correctly mentioned, it\u2019s excess body fat that more directly causes diabetes to develop; you can be long-term overweight and get diabetes without having eaten a single simple sugar food in your life (although glucose still gets formed by the breakdown of your meals).  My reply\u2019s really just focused on sugar re: diabetes.  Further mistakes/omissions in my insulin resistance mechanism explanation, but eh, come PhD this if you have the energy.

    "answer": "A headache is just that, a headache.  A migraine is a neurological condition that can come with fat more complex symptoms. these will often include a headache as an obvious one, but not always, and will often include other effects too.  Personally I can experience an aura distorting my vision (like looking at everything through the pattern made by the transporters in the original star trek), sickness, and numbness travelling through my arms and face alongside the headache (which is also a different type of headache, like a pressure behind the eyes).  Other people also experience things like a sensitivity to light or noise, and undoubtedly other things I am not aware of.  Some people have obvious triggers like certain foods or stresses, others are more of a mystery.  If I get a migraine, that is me often shut down for a day or more - the auras starting give me only a few minutes to stop doing things like driving before it becomes dangerous, and then I can be left dealing with the headache and vomiting for a significant period and unable to do anything else other than hiding in bed and trying to sleep through as much as possible. So no, not just a headache I can power through, but a complete show stopper for that day, and one that can cause major problems if I am not at home (or able to get a lift there within half an hour or so).",

    "answer": "Inequity is not a new problem, and it's not something that's suddenly started getting much worse.  While people like to compare Jeff Bezos' fortune to the average Amazon worker's salary and say \"inequality as never before\", that's not true.  It you compare the wealth of a 16th century french king to a 16th century peasant, the inequality was much worse in the 16th century.  Since the era of the pyramids (5000 years ago) it's been important for the people on the \"got a lot\" side of inequality to offer some justification for why they have so much more than everybody else.  Religion was invented for this purpose.  Kings were \"God on Earth\", or had \"Divine Right to Rule\".  The purpose of churches was to make the \"not got a lot\" people happy with the situation, and they often did that by promising them a better life in the future (aka after they died).  Religion has done its job for those thousands of years, so it's kept around.  While 25% of people in the US have no chosen religion, and that number is rising, everybody running for President is in favor of a religion.  We had a black President before an Atheist one, while black Americans are only 13% of the population, if you're looking for a group who are persecuted.",

    "answer": "The strength of materials is very well studied, but for most applications you don't get close to the limits so you don't need to worry about being exact  Factors of safety are the most common way to avoid needing to know *exactly* how strong your beams are and how much load is going on them.  Buildings and bridges have factors of safety of 4-6 generally.  So if you're building a bridge that should support 100 tons then you design it to support 600 tons so any variations in construction, or material (micro cracks or imperfections), or even dynamic loading(hurricane winds or an overloaded truck) won't be enough to overwhelm it.  Weight doesn't matter in non-moving applications so go extra strong and you don't need to do all the precise calculation and it'll last for a longgg time.  Airplanes are probably the thing with the lowest factor of safety, often only around 1.5 because weight matters a lot to airplanes.  The trade off here is that the materials are extensively studied, highly controlled, and the applications they're going into are well modeled so they know exactly how much force will be applied to the components.  If you have the time/money to over analyze every part of your system then you can trim it back, but a lot of engineering designs are \"how much will X weigh?  No more than 5?  Oh cool, i found this thing that'll hold 20, done!\" Nice big fudge factors mean even if you're off by 10-50% you're still okay.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is the relationship between the sampling rate of my audio stream and the frequency response of my headphones?",
    "answer": "the frequency response of a speaker is inherent to the speaker itself. It just means the drivers in the headphones will be able to produce frequencies between 15 and 28kHz, and doesn't have anything to do with the sample rate of the audio from your computer.  The sample rate and bit depth of an audio signal will dictate how perfectly the digital waveform will match the analog one. Say for example, you have a pure sine wave running into a recording interface. This gets converted by an ADC into a digital version. If your sample rate is really bad, it will end up looking like a square wave, or a kind of stepped triangle wave. If its good, it will be really close to a sine wave. Then digital filters can be used to smooth all the sharp edges and make it a nice round wave again.  The sample rate being 2x your sound frequency is the nyquist theorem. It has nothing to do with doubling the frequencies you are hearing or playing back within the audio itself; what it means is if you are only interested in the audio range (up to \\~20kHz), you need at least a 40kHz sample rate to not get any aliasing or artifacts. It's 2x the highest frequency you care about.",
    "follow-up": "Okay, but I'm correct that to reproduce 44 KHz audio, you need speakers or headphones with at least a frequency range of \\~0 - 22 KHz?

    "question": "ELI5: why do we still use asphalt for roads if it's harming the environment?",
    "answer": "The problem might not be as big as you have been made to beleave. The amount of area covered in asphalt is negligable compared to the total area of the Earth. Even other human land uses such as roofs is a bigger issue. And things like planting trees contribute far more to global warming due to darkening of areas then a few asphalt roads do.  In addition asphalt tends to be dark only when freshly laid. After some use the dark binder on the top wear off leaving only the agregate visible which tends to be of a lighter local stone. It have even been common for workers to put down a layer of pure agregate as a top layer when laying asphalt in order to both save costs and reduce environmental impact. This produces a lighter color rougher surface like if the asphalt was already worn. Local businesses does also ask to use lighter rocks for agregate if heat is an issue when laying asphalt for parking spaces and sidewalks.  Paint would be one of the worst thing to do. Firstly the reason we use asphalt is because of its high friction which is required to allow cars to go at high speeds without sliding out of control. Paint have much lower friction and can therefore only be used sparingly. This is why you should avoid driving on the road markings. Secondly paint is far less durable then asphalt. Dust from asphalt is already a huge issue in cities and adding a lot of plastic dust from the paint wearing off is not the best way to solve the issue of global warming.  Of course the best option of all is if we can all stop driving cars and instead use public transport. Especially railed transport is a much better technical solution to moving around with the least environmental impact.",

We can make devices that count the number of times the crystal has vibrated. So if the crystal is one that vibrates roughly 16,000 times per second, we can connect that counter to a device that counts up to 16,000 then sends a signal. Every signal represents 1 second passing. Now that we have a device that can count seconds (or fractions of a second), we can make a clock! (This is how digital watches work!)  So basically DSLRs and computers have tiny digital watches inside without a screen.   This isn't always super accurate. Cheaper crystals and mechanisms aren't exactly perfect.

    "question": "eli5 - how much better is the James Webb Space Telescope than Hubble ? Is it like a leap from SD to 4K or even greater still ?",
    "answer": "Light takes time to travel.   Here on Earth and in such small scales, light is almost instant; however, when you increase in distance, so too does light's travel time. Light from the Sun takes eight minutes to reach Earth, so when you look up at the Sun (please, with proper protection) you are quite literally seeing the Sun as it was eight minutes ago. You are looking eight minutes in the past! You're a glorified time traveler!  Now let's increase the distance to five light-years, with a single light-year being the distance light travels in one year in a vacuum. If you point a telescope towards something that is five light-years away, you are seeing that object as it was five years ago.  Now, while light travels through space-time, space-time itself expands. The expansion of the Universe and the space-time within it causes light to *shift* towards red wavelengths. The further out you look, the more red an object will appear.  This shift is Doppler Shift. You can experience this with sound! Did you ever hear a car drive closer and closer towards your position and it sounds like it's increasing in frequency? And the moment it passes you that frequency sounds like it's decreasing? That [*\"\"Neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-oooooooooooooooooooo\"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC4Lp7k4zrI) sound is Doppler Shift with sound frequencies. The same can be applied to the electromagnetic spectrum (the spectrum in which light is apart of).  Now what does this have to do with Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)?  Well, Hubble detects visible light (what our human eyes can see), along with ***some*** ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelengths. It's a very narrow part of the spectrum of what Hubble can detect.  Now when we point Hubble outwards into the vast distance of the Universe, this light shifts and becomes more and more red! So red in fact that their light is no longer in the visible spectrum, it's in the infrared wavelengths! Bonkers right! Now because it's so in the infrared wavelengths, Hubble can no longer detect these far away objects.  Remember when I said the farther away an object is the longer it takes for the light to reach us? Well, these objects are so far away that the light we are looking at was emitted close to the birth of the universe--the Big Bang! Wow!  But the further we look out and back in time, the more red these objects are. The more invisible they become to Hubble.  Here is where JWST comes into play. As you can see [here](https://imgur.com/dsUafLF), JWST is specializing in the infrared wavelengths while Hubble specializes in the visible spectrum.   Now we have a telescope that can see redder objects, objects that are *wayyyy* out there. These objects are so far back in time that they will help us write/discover the first chapters of the universe. Hubble gave us chapters all the way back to Chapter 4, but JWST will give us Chapters 3-to-2, maybe the later half of Chapter 1! Who knows what we'll discover!  Now, because the JWST specializes in infrared light, NASA and its international partners had to plan around the heat emitted from the Earth and Sun. That is why its orbit is placed 1.5m km (1m miles) away from Earth in L2. Additionally, they added solar shielding to block solar heat from tampering with its sensors! These temperatures fluctuate, but as of writing this comment, the hot side (facing the Sun) is currently 130 degrees F, while the cold side (facing away from the Sun and Earth) is currently -328 degrees F. So cold!  Finally to answer your question, technically the JWST is more powerful than Hubble; however, it's unfair to say it's overall better than it because both are just designed for different mission sets. Yes, the JWST is the successor to Hubble but they'll still work in tandem and help with scientific discoveries!.  I hope this helps!",

    "question": "ELI5: Why isnt Omicron a good thing?",
    "answer": "Ever played Pandemic? The way you win Pandemic is to be *highly* infectious but very low lethality. Then, once the entire world is infected, you buy heart failure.   Reality doesn't work like that - the same mutation doesn't arise simultaneously in all instances of the virus - but the important part, that high infectivity, low lethality viruses are S tier, is true. High infectivity and low lethality allows the virus to propagate and multiply. The more people are infected, the more copies of the virus there are. The more copies of the virus there are, the more opportunities the virus has to develop new mutations.   Omicron will already have mutated a bunch of times. Most of those mutations won't change anything. Some of them will make it less effective. Some of them will make it more infective. Some of them will make it more deadly, meaning it's both high infectivity and high lethality. When that happens (and it is a when, not an if), it'll become the next major variant and it could potentially be worse than the first wave. Basically, the fewer people infected, the less likely new mutations are to emerge. A strain that can infect a lot of people is bad because of the future mutation potential.  There's also a matter of simple maths. Imagine that Delta Covid infects 10,000 people per day and hospitalises 1% of infected. That's 100 new admissions to hospitals per day. Now imagine Omicron has half the hospitalisation rate of Delta, but has three times the infectivity. Omicron infects 30,000 people per day, and hospitalises 0.5% of them. That's 150 new admissions per day. That's worse overall even though Omicron is less lethal individually, because it's infecting so many more people.",

    "question": "ELI5:What is animal instinct ?",
    "answer": "Instincts are complex innate behaviours, reflexes are simple innate behaviours. For instance, when a human baby is dipped underwater, it immediately holds its breath. That's a reflex.  When a sea turtle hatches from its egg, it heads straight for the ocean. That's far more complex than just holding your breath so we consider it instinctual behaviour.  The behaviour of complex living organisms is largely governed by brain chemistry and hormones in particular. When you find yourself in a surprising situation, it's a hormonal response that causes you to feel afraid, aggressive, overjoyed or any other emotion. And your behaviour will result from that.   I'm sure you've heard of the fight or flight response in the face of something scary for instance. Something surprises the organism and the brain immediately gives a response that causes the organism to respond with aggression or fear.  So now that we understand that brain chemistry can determine how an organism behaves. We're also closer to understanding how instinctual behaviour is \"stored\" or passed on from parent to sibling.  Take those hatching sea turtles for instance. Sea turtles immediately head for the ocean by heading towards the brightest patch of the horizon in their field of vision. If they keep doing that, they'll find the quickest route to the water.  There are many possible reactions a baby turtle could take after hatching:  * It could lie still and rest after the exertion of hatching * It could start looking for food to replenish its energy after hatching * It could set off in a random direction * It could follow the scent of water (and risk ending up in the wrong body of water rather than the ocean)  But lots of animals are hanging around for the express purpose of feasting on the hatching baby turtles.  So natural selection means that the lazy turtles, the lost turtles, the wandering turtles are the first to die. And the turtles whose brain chemistry urges them to get moving, to head towards the light on the horizon and to get into the water are the ones that survive the most.  The turtles who survive the most pass on their genes the most. Evolution simply means that for baby turtles, those whose brain chemistry urges them to rush for the ocean fastest are the best young survivors. And over time that means that every single turtle that hatches has the overwhelming desire to race to the water.  That's instinct. And that's how instinct is stored and passed on. They are chemical balances in the brain that produce behaviour that is so beneficial to survival that pretty much every member of a species has it. Because all others die.",
    "follow-up": "Thanks for a very detailed reply. I understand natural selection and how evolutionary traits can favor an adaptation in an organism. Instinct, however seems to be on a different level entirely. For example a newly born chick instinctively knows to open its mouth when food is offered. This happens from the moment of birth - it's not learned.   If these traits are truly 'ingrained' in our DNA, as another poster suggested,  then  we would be able to detect them and manipulate the instinct. Surely DNA is composed  of a series of nucleotides.

    "question": "ELI5: Why does food's taste fade away the more we chew it?",
    "answer": "This phenomenon varies between different food types. Put simply, as you chew, your saliva dissolves the food in your mouth to help you swallow it. The first thing your saliva touches is the outer layer of your food. In the case of prepared meals like steak and pasta, the main flavor is on the outermost layer of your food, as you chew and swallow the saliva in your mouth it takes the flavors (herbs, spices, salt, seared crust etc.) down with it and you taste more of the remaining meat or wheat in these examples, which don't taste as flavorful without that outer seasoning. This is also why if you don't like the flavor of broccoli or peas, they taste worse the more you chew them, since the seasoning washes down with your saliva and the vegetable taste starts coming out.  You'll notice that this doesn't happen with fruits, ice cream, or chocolate etc. since in those cases all layers of what you're eating have the same flavor.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is Cyclic Voltammetry and what does it aim to do?",
    "answer": "It's been a long time since I've done this so forgive me any errors or omissions.  You have some substance in a solution. Then you stick electrodes into it and apply voltage to it. You slowly increase the voltage to some set amount over time, then once you get to the max you slowly decrease it back down. The whole time you're measuring how much current flows, which in turn tells you about how much resistance the solution you're analyzing has at each level of voltage. This is generally done by some computerized set up or machine that controls the voltage and measures the current/resistance and plots it on a graph [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_voltammetry#/media/File:Cyclovoltammogram.jpg). It's also generally done several times in a row. So you might go from 0V to 12V (or -9V to 9V or whatever) then back to 0V then back to 12V for several repetitions. This is where the word \"cyclic\" in the name comes from.  So what's the point? Well we're measuring the electrochemical properties of whatever's in the solution. If you get nice smooth line instead of something like that picture I linked above, there's not much interesting going on chemically, it only really tells you about what the electrical resistance of the solution is. In that picture I linked, the substance is undergoing some kind of chemical reaction as the voltage goes up and down, specifically an oxidation-reduction reaction. Those two humps (one hump is oxidation, the other is reduction) going up and down tell you what at what voltage the reaction occurs. The size of the humps (peak current) tells you a bunch of stuff about the reaction that I can't exactly remember at the moment.  There's a number of other things you can measure with this technique (and I'm surely forgetting most of them). One of the interesting ones though is that you can keep running the experiment for a long time having it constantly sweep back and forth. Then you can count how many sweeps it takes until the humps in the graph diminish in size by some appreaciable amount. This gives an idea of how many times the substance your measuring can react back and forth (this is a reversible reaction after all, though if you only get one sweep it means the reaction is not reversible). So, for example, you might be testing some material you want to use for a battery. This measurement gives an idea about how many times that battery could recharge.",

    "answer": "your entire body works very hard to try to stay balanced, and the process is more complicated than simply throwing out the bad and keeping the good.    you can think of it as a puzzle where you want everything as even as possible,  but you arent allowed to have any empty slots.  if you want to throw out sodium you need to fill the spot the sodium is in with something else similar enough to fit there.  if you want more calcium you need to try to throw out something in a calcium shaped spot.    while drinking water after ingesting too much sodium helps with short term symptoms such as dehydration or cramps,  it usually does not supply the necessary pieces to fill in the sodium spots when sodium is thrown away. those still need to be taken from elsewhere.    so a large excess of sodium long term heavily taxes the body by causing a loss of other similar nutrients that cant be absorbed since there are no open spots for them, heavily taxes organs like the kidney that are trying to move sodium everyday when it doesnt have enough puzzle pieces to keep up with the consupmtion, and can eventually cause even further unbalances as other puzzle pieces have to be reshuffled to attempt to balance with the sodium.    p.s.  the reason water retains with sodium  is because your body is struggling to find pieces to trade out with the sodium and must keep it.  the water is kept as well to prevent those immediate issues of sodium like dehydration and cramps etc.  but doesnt fix the core issue.    ***tldr having a very high amount of sodium is like playing a game of tetris with a ton of one piece and hardly any of the others.  your body tries to adapt but eventually you end up with more and more pieces on the board that are sodium and no way to get rid of them.  while water can help short term with sodium consumption it doesnt give your body the needed pieces to clear a board full of sodium, and instead fills the board up even more as a piece that glues itself to sodium.***",

    "answer": "RAM is fast, but volatile. SSDs wear out, but can hold their content when powered off.   Latency is one property of the physical difference between RAM and SSDs. RAM has a latency of about 15-30 ns, whereas SSDs have about 5-20 ms (1000-fold slower).  You asked why. Physics. To store bits you have to charge the logic. The bigger the barrier to change a 1 to a 0, the harder it is to lose the charge. RAM has a small barrier and thus can be written faster and more often, but loses its charges when powered down. To change a state in an SSD the barrier is so high, you\u2018ll need a lot of energy to overcome it and trap the electrons in the logic. The damage done is bigger over time and it takes longer to write.",

Europeans likely evolved that way during the last ice age to absorb more sunlight due to the lack of vitamin D in our diet while people of African decent kept a darker skin tone to ward off sunburn and skin cancer in the lower and sunnier latitudes.  The trade off for animals like cows and deer is that while grasses are very easy to find and consume, eating grass doesn't give you nearly as much energy as eating meat.

When an electron and a proton are near each other their interaction is attractive rather than repulsive as they have opposite charges.

Similarly, glass is generally pretty good at blocking (some) ultraviolet light. We don't notice because we can't see it, but if we could see in UV windows would look solid, like walls.  The specific patterns of what frequencies are absorbed by what materials are complicated and we don't want to get into them. But walls are transparent to some frequencies of radio waves (they are also pretty good at bending around corners). Some frequencies may have issues going through walls (like light going through a frosted glass window), but that isn't as much of a problem for radio signals as we don't need to receive the full image (like we do for seeing things), just the signal from one bit.

Once the probe and nozzle have met, the pilot of the aircraft being refuelled can also move forwards slightly so that the pipe from the tanker isn't taut, but is being pushed forwards by the jet - this means there is a little slack in the hose, and the jet can move a little bit laterally without pulling the probe out and disconnecting accidentally.  With some tankers there is also some control on the tankers end too - with a more rigid pipe and some control surfaces attached to the nozzle itself, an observer inside the tanker can watch over the process and 'fly' the nozzle - adjusting it's position to help align it with the jet to be refuelled.",

For instance, the most common scale in western music is the major scale. You can pick any note and play a major scale starting with that note. If you pick the major scale starting on C, the notes will be C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. If you pick the G major scale, the notes will be G, A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. To figure it out yourself, use this pattern: you can pick a note (call it the *root note* of the scale), then move up the keyboard (to the right) by this set of steps: skip a note, skip a note, don't skip a note, skip a note, skip a note, skip a note, don't skip a note. And that's a major scale.  If you were to \"play in a scale\", you can play any of the notes in that scale in whatever order you want, and they'll \"sound good\" with anyone else playing in that scale.  There are a lot of different kind of scales, and using them in different ways, in combination with each other, helps us to make interesting songs, based on the basic concept of tension and release.",

If you connect multiple power stations that don't have the same frequency (or even the same position in the AC wave), it would cause a massive current to flow from one power station to the other, since one power station would be at a different voltage at the same point in time, and current flows from high voltage point to low voltage point.

    "answer": "A naked short is an illegal practice in which an institution borrows a share of a stock and shorts it, except the share has not been determined to exist.   For example, say there are 1 million shares of a company. A normal short would be borrowing 100 shares and paying a premium to open a contract giving you the right to sell those shares at a price (the strike price) regardless of what the price is. This means if the stock goes down you can sell it for more than its worth. A naked short, is borrowing shares that aren\u2019t determined to exist. This means if there are 1 million shares, and someone\u2019s buys short contracts worth more shares than what exist in the market, it\u2019s artificial.   This is illegal because it creates an artificial market with non existent shares and mostly undermines the whole system. However this is a common practice by many financial institutions such as hedge funds (citadel for example).   As for what happened on CNBC, an anchor woman actually called what the current hedge funds and market participants naked shorting, in reference to AMC and GameStop stock. This is significant because naked shorting is illegal. So a trusted financial news source like CNBC on air saying it\u2019s naked shorting is validating the reason why many people are buying and holding shares of company\u2019s like AMC and GameStop.   There are many smarter people who can explain this better but hey I did my best.   For more information check out r/superstonk and maybe ask on r/outoftheloop and someone there will explain better.

An NFT is basically is basically a digital autograph. It's a sign that cannot really be faked, with your name on it, attached to a digital file (image, video, whatever...). The file can still be copied, just as other people can have a similar baseball, but the autograph is unique. And since it has your name on it, and cannot really be \"stolen\"",
    "follow-up": "This is a bad analogy IMHO because the autograph on the baseball is what makes the baseball valuable, and has nothing to do with ownership. People don't typically collect baseballs with their own autographs. Also, a baseball is a physical asset so it can only live in one place at a time, unlike a digital asset which can be copied infinitely.  TBH it's very hard to come up with a GOOD metaphor for NFTs because 1) \"ownership\" of digital assets is pretty nebulous and 2) even as a proof of ownership NFTs still don't really mean much.  If we were going to come up with the most accurate metaphor using an autographed baseball, it would be that a famous baseball player autographed a baseball, took a picture of it, and then sold that image online and gave you a receipt and a link to the file on their website.

From the FAQ for the study I am in:  >**How can this test tell the difference between antibodies produced from infection and antibodies produced from vaccination?**   When a person is infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, their body makes antibodies in response to several viral proteins, including nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein. The vaccines currently approved for use in the UK only trigger antibodies against spike (S) protein.   The lateral flow devices (LFDs) that we used in the self-test antibody study detected antibodies to the spike protein so we were unable to tell if the antibodies were due to infection or to the vaccine (which is why you have been asked to provide this blood sample).

Which gets pumped back into the ocean, and can cause issues with the area it gets pumped into getting too salty and killing off everything.  The limitation is cost.

    "question": "ELI5: How is electricity physically measured (like at the meter on my house)?",
    "answer": "Maybe not ELI5, but here you go.  Electricity is the flow of electrons.   Electrons flow because they are pushed by a *voltage*. The voltage is like the pressure causes water to flow in a pipe.  The amount of electrons that flow is termed the *current*. The current is like the flowrate of water in the pipe.  More voltage (pressure) = more current (flow).  So if you want to talk about flow, you might say there are 10 electrons travelling past a point every second (electrons per second), just like how you might talk about water flow in litres or gallons per second.  If you want to find the total volume of water, you take the flow and multiply it by time. So if you had 10 litres per second, after 100 seconds you used 10\u00d7100=1000 litres.  Same for electricity. You take the amperage, and multiply it by time. We could do electrons per second, but we use Amperes to measure current. We also use hours instead of seconds.  So what do you get when you multiply Amperes and Hours? Ampere-hour (Ah), which is what you see on your electricity bill. The ampere-hour is the amount of electricity you used.  Now we know how you measure time, but what about current?  Inside your meter is a *current transformer*. This consists of a metal donut that surrounds the main conductor going into your house. A copper wire is coiled around the donut.  The electricity going through the main conductor is AC (*alternating current*). Now when electricity flows, it creates a magnetic field. When that current *alternates*, so does the magnetic field. So you have an *alternating magnetic field* surrounding the main conductor. This fluctuating magnetic field causes magnetic field lines to pass through that copper coil in your little current transformer, and that *induces* a small current in the copper coil.  This copper coil is connected to a smarter device which includes an ammeter which measures the current. This is then used to calculate the current in the main conductor.  The current \u00d7 time calculation is done at small intervals and added together to account for varying loads.",

The most precise measurements are based on the [Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background).  There is a convenient reference frame called the [comoving frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoving_coordinates#Comoving_coordinates), in which the CMB light coming from all directions is equally redshifted.  This is also the reference frame in which the universe is the oldest, and is the reference frame we use when doing most cosmology.  Our solar system is moving at about 371 km/s relative to the comoving frame, which gives a time dilation factor of only 1.0000008, which is why it doesn't matter much what (reasonable) reference frame we pick.

    "answer": "I've answered this in another thread. The OS uses a generic command and ACPI BIOS to send power commands through the system bus to the Power Supply and Peripherals.  Each peripheral will enter a power mode and shutdown or move to an idle state in a safe manner. The onboard logic of each peripheral knows how to do this. So the hard drive will park safely and flush caches as needed. The CPU will enter a different CPU power state.  The Power Supply will then enter an idle power state and will switch state to full power after x amount of time.  As long as the power supply is plugged in and the ATX switch is on the power supply will be receiving power and will be active or idle. The computer may seem off but it is not.  A full shutdown wil place the power supply into idle and will not power certain devices of a certain power range so your hard drive and fans will be powered off.  Your CPU, Motherboard and some peripherals such as your network card will receive a small amount of power in this state.  A restart will bring all power lines back up to full power causing your hard drive to activate which will start the boot process.",

    "answer": "Commonly referred to a socialized medicine. Essentialy government run, tax funded single-payer healthcare system.   Most European and lots of asian countries have various spins on this. A familiar example might be Canada. Each province (state) has a provincial healthcare body that runs all of the hospitals, pays for all the doctors, nurses, MRI machines etc. Resources are funded and allocated where the demand is. i.e. a hospital in a growing city gets more doctors and machines and testing labs etc.   So unlike in the US, where healthcare is paid for almost entirely by private healthcare insurance plans, along with huge deductibles where patients have to pay out of pocket, in Canada (for example), you just rock up to the hospital with a broken leg, wait until its your turn, leg gets an x-ray, reset, a cast and you go home. Most you'll have to pay for is parking at the hospital and a drink from the ER vending machine.   The criticism is that for non-critical procedures and injuries, depending on priority you can wait some time for your \"free\" healthcare. Its not uncommon to be in the ER room of a hospital with a broken bone for 3-4 hrs. Its not uncommon to have a several month waitlist for joint replacement surgery. You might have to wait a few days or a few weeks for an MRI or some type of test. But its all done on a priority basis. Mostly. But its free (as in paid for by everyone's taxes).  Comparatively, in the US, you rock up to a hospital and you get an x-ray, pain killers, see a doctor, have a cast set all within an hour. Or if need be, you can have an MRI _today_ if you're willing to pay for it. There's somewhat of an excess of capacity, that's part of the reason its so expensive.",

    "question": "ELI5: how do we know that\u2019s it\u2019s not possible for something to go faster than light?",
    "answer": "When we describe waves moving about in physics, we usually need to describe a) the speed of the waves in the medium, and b) the speed of the medium itself.  For example, the speed of the wave on a coffee cup in a car's cup holder is the speed of the wave in the coffe, plus the speed of the coffee itself (which is moving at the speed of the car)   However, when it comes to electromagnetism, it appeared that there was no equation that told us the speed of the thing that light was travelling in. In Maxwell's equations, the vacuum speed of light just always equal to c.  This means that regardless of the source, whether it a lamp, or a moving car, or the Sun, or a spaceship flying towards me, I will always measure the speed of light from any of these sources to be c.  Turning that around, it also means that if I ever try to accelerate myself even faster, I will still _always_ measure the speed of my headlights to be c, which is why you can never accelerate faster than the speed of light.  Side note: Relativity is not something that ELI5 friendly tbh, but I hope I've skipped enough steps to make it understandable.",
    "follow-up": "This explanation is a bit more technical than the ones that describe the energy costs getting higher and higher, but in my opinion it's also ultimately more fundamental.  No matter how close you think you're getting to achieving a velocity of C, you're still exactly as far away from it as you were before.  This is a trait known as \"Lorentz-invariance\" and is what really makes the velocity C so special.  In fact, the whole paradox posed by Lorentz invariance is the heart behind relativity itself.  How is it that when two observers, one sitting on Earth and the other sitting on a spaceship traveling away from Earth at 150,000,000 m/s could both measure the same ray of light, and both conclude somehow that the ray is traveling just shy of 300,000,000 m/s compared to them?  Under Newtonian physics, that should be impossible - one person should see the light moving faster than the other (depending on which direction it was traveling).  Yet despite that, they *do* both see the light moving at apparently the same relative velocity.  How?  Relativity is the answer.  Essentially, the concepts of time and velocity are both entirely relative.  They depend on your frame of reference.  If you start moving, what you measure fundamentally changes, and it does so in a way that no matter how you look at it you can't break the light-barrier from your perspective.  It's perfectly possible to get in a spaceship, accelerate to 95% of C compared to a planet, hop out into a pod and accelerate an additional 95% of C compared to you spaceship, then jump out in a spacesuit with a relativistic jet pack and accelerate yet another 95% of C compared to your pod.  You can do that just fine.  Yet, when you look back at the planet from your suit, it's somehow still flying away at only 99.9999...% of C.",

That said, three of the things that a lot of processed foods have in common is that they are easy to get, easy to prep, and easy to eat a lot of. They stay stable on store and warehouse shelves for longer, so they tend to be cheaper and in stock more often. A lot of the challenging prep work like the gardening, cutting, and cooking are done for you, making it easy. They also tend to have a lot of the extra food removed during the manufacturing process, so they are more calorie dense per bite.   Sugar is the big deal in my opinion. We consume so much more sugar these days than we used too. Candy, soda, sugar filled \"low fat\" options, \"health foods\" like granola that are packed with sugar, etc...  Combine those factors, and you've got people doing less work to eat denser foods. Thats going to result in weight gain, no matter how healthy or unhealthy the individual foods are.",

Modern tanks will be a bit fancier but the general theory is the same  For a Clutch-Brake system, power goes to the differential which tries to split the power between the two sides.  If you want to turn left you engage either the wheel or a lever that at first just opens the clutch to the left side track so only the right side is powered and moving faster but the left is free spinning and this will cause the tank to turn to the left.  If you need to turn really sharply you keep turning/pulling the lever and the brakes are applied to the left track so its now at a dead stop and only the right track is being powered this lets the tank make very sharp turns.  This type of system isn't nearly as graceful at turning as the Rack and Pinion system in your car that gives you very gradual control, but it can handle a huge amount of power.",

If I tell you to picture an apple for five seconds, what happens inside your head?  Some people will think using language: they become aware of words forming in their head that state out the thought they have. Some people will compare this to \"hearing\" a voice in your head but I always go very carefully in to those analogies because I've found people thinking they don't have an internal monologue because they literally don't hear an audible voice going off in their head.  Many people will also use images: when people imagine something they become aware of an \"image\". Usually this image doesn't have a lot of detail and it's hard to keep it steady for long, but people generally will f.i get a sense of a red apple with a stem and two leaves when asked to picture an apple. This is often likened to \"seeing\" stuff in your head, but note that most people don't hallucinate and see a floating apple ten inches in front of their head, even if they are imagining something.  People can think in all sorts of senses and often a mix of them: they picture apples, hear their favorite songs, recall a bad smell. This all happens on a scale, some have stronger connections to certain senses than others and will be more visual thinkers, or more tactile, or have stronger internal emotions, or whatever. Whatever is happening in your head when I ask you to think about something, try to imagine doing that in relation to one of your senses.

    "question": "ELI5: Where do permanently deleted files go in a computer?",
    "answer": "Your computer keeps track of its files via a *file system*. The exact details vary, but basically, it's a system that keeps track of which files are where. When you want to save a new text document, the file system takes that command from your text editor and says \"OK, I need to allocate 200 kB for this text document. Where's the best place to do that?\" Once it picks a place to save the file, it takes the information and puts it on the storage device (like, a tiny physical piece of the hard drive or other storage the information will reside on). It keeps a record that file <x> is located at position <y>. When you want to open that file again, your text editor tells the file system \"hey, I want this text document\" and the file system looks in its record book to see where that's located, and tells the storage to return the information stored there. If you add up the sizes of all the files that are written down in that record book, that's how much disk space you're using.  When you delete a file through a normal way (like the OS delete interface), it doesn't generally actually go back and erase the information stored on the physical hard drive. There's no need to do that, and it would take time - a lot of time for big files. Instead, all it does is tell the file system to erase the record of where that file is stored. That means that in the future, the file system doesn't know there's information there and can pick that area to store other information - a new file. This is much faster. But it does mean that until and unless a new file is written to that physical location, the information is still there.",

The problem is that I can read a chapter and have no idea what I read. You could take the book away from me, ask me about some really important details, like a character's name, and I'd have no idea.   It's really frustrating to and it's why I don't read much.  When I'm reading, my eyes are scanning the words, I know the words make their way into my brain but since I'm usually day dreaming at the same time, the words from the book don't get processed. I don't know where they go, but it's not into my brain. The result is that when I notice myself doing it, I have to go back and start from the last thing I remember which usually means reading the same few pages or the same chapter multiple times.   I'd suggest comparing it trying to read with music playing, but I think more people than I realize can do that just fine. Personally, I can't.

So just because your mom's dad is bald doesn't mean you will be but your chances are higher. Now if your y chromosome,  which you get from your dad, carries one of those other baldness genes NOT related to the x chromosome,  you still have a chance of being bald even if you did not inherit your mother's chromosome that has the main baldness gene.

    "answer": "To add,  9,192,631,770 is a *very specific number*... How did we get to that? It's a long and fascinating history how we have tried to define units of measure. At first, they were arbitrary, then people bumped into problems. Like, the foot - presume our feet are different lengths... I can go even earlier with the cubit, supposedly the length from your elbow to your finger tip. Can you see a problem here?  So the second was first a division of a day. Then it was a fraction of a solar day. Then it was defined by a fraction of a year, because our orbit around the sun is more stable than our rotation about our axis. A lot changed starting in the 1940s with the quartz clock.  But the thing is, we had, for a long, long time, a pretty much agreed upon definition for what a second was, if not imperfect. So if you're going to invent an atomic clock, or any device that is really, really accurate at counting divisions of time, then you're going to want to fit it to peoples expectations. They back-fit the definition to what was approximately a second, since a second prior was always approximate anyway.  But it's really hard to define a \"base\" unit of time. What is the smallest unit of time that there can be? The smallest unit of time that can be measured? We don't actually know. We have concepts of smallest units, called Planck units of distance and time, but they keep getting smaller every few years, we haven't found the floor yet. And the latest and greatest atomic clocks can count the smallest units yet, but we don't know what tomorrow will bring.",

They're defined by the Planck constant, the gravitational constant, and the speed of light. Now, while it's true that the accepted value can change as we get more accurate measurements of these constants, nothing about that implies a trend towards smaller values.

When I was a student, we had this one gentleman that refused to see a primary care doctor because his ER visit copay was $0. So every month when his blood pressure meds ran low, he would walk into the ER and get a prescription for blood pressure meds. Imagine how much each visit would cost the insurance company. Now if only the insurance company would put some kind of \"petty and dumb sum of money\" that is greater than a non ER doctor visit. This could reduce strain onto the healthcare system.

I'll take a stab at lowering that to 5  'grounding' is basically needed to ensure that everything is at the same 'electrical level' (voltage).The hazard of not grounding something is that if the electrical level (voltage) is different in one place compared to another and you touch both, it becomes level by going through you (not good). So as long as everything you touch is all the same level it won't go through you because there is nowhere for it to go. As long as everything in the ISS is all connected to the frame so that it is all the same level (voltage) you are safe.  This is why if a utility truck touches a power line and a worker gets out and touches the truck (high level/voltage) and the ground (low level/voltage) at the same time the electricity goes through their body and shocks them badly. If their co-worker JUMPS onto the ground and is never the bridge between the two levels (voltages) at the same time, they will be safe.  The important thing isn't dirt, it's that everything is the same 'level' of electrified.",

Raindrops fall fairly slowly - the very largest raindrops fall at [about 10 m/s or a little over 20 mph](https://gpm.nasa.gov/resources/faq/how-fast-do-raindrops-fall). That means that if you're going at highway speeds (say, 30 m/s), the tilt of the rain is very sharp.

So, because the maximum speed at which rain falls is about 20-25 miles per hour (depending on the size of the rain droplet), and the rain is effectively moving 60 mph to the side compared to your car at the same time, the angle that the rain is moving is actually closer to being a flat horizontal line than a straight vertical line, thus making it difficult for it to hit the back window of your car.",

The prefix post- doesn't mean \"rejection of\" in labelling these kinds of philosophical and artistic movements, but rather more \"acceptance of and progression from.\" So post-modernism is an acceptance of and progression from some of the things you attribute to it here.  To understand modernity and modernism as a broad ideology, it helps to consider the early 20thC context, where colonial atrocities and the horrors of WWI were starting to be hard to ignore for intellectuals. Modernists were intrinsically disillusioned by the old grand truths (or metanarratives) of the Western world: War is honourable. Religion is Civilization. Science is Progress. Modernists skewed nihilist. They sought to represent reality with granular truth, not grand truth, in formally innovative ways, and if the outcome was against moralistic messages of the past, so be it.  Post-modernism came about not as a rejection of this, but more as an acceptance that our structures and metanarratives, however illusionary,  are how we create meaning. They just tend to approach these grand institutions ironically (think a screenprinted soup can on an art gallery's wall: it's not denying cultural values, it's just trying to re-evaluate them in interesting ways. Or a Tarantino film that uses a generic Western franchise in homage, but also to discuss race by revising history). So where modernism was dismissive of grand narratives (like the American Dream), post-modernism is generally more playful. A lot of what we call post-modern is actually just modern, mind you.",

    "answer": "There are no modern battleships, the last battleship built was the HMS Vanguard and it commissioned in 1946.  WWII spelled the end of the battleship era and the rise of the plane  The modern ships with just 1 or 2 5\" guns are Destroyers/Cruisers (The US has ambiguous crossover here) that are armed primarily with missiles. A 16\" battleship might be able to fire a shell 30 miles but it can't accurately hit a target at that range, a Tomahawk missile on the other hand can hit a target from over 800 miles away so you can take out the target while never getting close enough to be in danger.  Battleships are massive, expensive, high crew, high maintenance ships that are outclassed by modern weaponry and aren't the best solution for modern problems.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why does exercise help with so many health problems?",
    "answer": "The heart is a muscle, and a strong muscle will always out perform a weak one. Aka, your heart will be better at circulating blood if it's in good shape, thus allowing more blood to get to \"injured\" places in the body, thus healing them faster.  Also, increased exercise causes decreased fat in the body. Fat clogs arteries making blood flow slower. Your body also has to work harder in general to support the extra weight. So, decrease your fat and you'll increase your performance in all areas.  Here's an example. Let's say your liver is damaged. It needs 100 blood cells per hour to heal. Your heart is only able to deliver 75 per hour because it's weak. On top of that you have fat, restricting blood flow, so that 75 cells goes down to 50. It will now take your liver twice as long to heal than if your heart was strong and you had less fat.",

Show an Eb alto saxophone a C, you get an Eb.   This is also true of natural horns, which during the Classical era were pitched in very diverse keys. Show a D horn a C, you get a D. It get's a bit tricky to keep the octave straight (as in, which D) but generally transposing instruments sound lower than concert pitch, with only a few sounding higher. This includes piccolo and glockenspiel.",

Resistance exercise hypertrophies (makes the heart bigger) the heart due to increased blood flow during lifting along with usage of the vulsalva maneuver, but does not necessarily lead to improved blood flow dynamics and efficiencies. However, resistance exercise has obvious other benefits though such as leading to bigger muscles (good aestetically and for everyday strength) and combating musculoskeletal deficiencies and diseases.  On the other hand, moderate-high intensity cardio exercise is typically seen to lead to improved blood flow efficiencies along with a stronger heart and indicators of increased performance metrics such as improved VO2max which has shown to lead to a higher quality of life.  Both types of exercise have benefits such as improved glucose (sugar) uptake which helps with diseases such as diabetes, has shown to have mental health and motivational benefits, and combats obesity which is related to other diseases.

So a number of prion diseases can spread between different animal species. When a prion disease does infect someone it does not usually cause harm by itself but it does prevent the protein from doing its intended job which can be deadly. The problem with prions is that it is not actually anything foreign as the proteins that cause the disease are made by your own cells according to your own genes.

    "question": "eli5: is electron and volt produce at the same time ?",
    "answer": "There are two types of charges usually denoted as positive and negative and equal charges repel each other while opposite charges attract each other.  Now electrons are basically the fundamental particles that carry the negative charge and they also happen to be the ones that are moving. Positive charges usually are found with protons in the core of the atoms which usually remain stationary.  Now under normal conditions atoms are not charged because there are as many positively charged particles as there are negatively charged particles. So a charged atom or ion, usually has either too many or too few electrons and thus carries a net charged.  So if it has too many electrons in it's vincinity would like to make it neutral again, because they are attracted to the positive charge whereas if it has too many electrons, then those would like to get away from the other electrons and move to some place with less electrons.  So if you have a copper wire and on one end you put loads of stuff in need of electrons and on the other end you put something with loads of electrons then the electrons in the wire will try to move from one end to the other. So something like this:  \\+1 - 0 - 0 -0 - 0 - (-1)  So +1 is your positive end and (-1) is your negative end and the \"-0-\" are neutral pieces in this chain/wire. So in the next step one electron will move to the open place at the positive end and leave a vacancy at it's previous place:  0 - (+1) - 0 - 0 -0 (-1)  And so the charge travels from one end to the other. As said it's technically the electrons moving to the left, but you can also pretend as if a positive charge is moving to the right. Which engineers determined to be the way to look at it for historical reasons.  So electrons are usually not created in this process they just move from one atom to the next following the slope of charge. And that slope is called a difference in potential and measured in volt. So if you apply a voltage you basically set up such a difference in electrons on those ends and that makes the electrons move. And btw that movement would then be called a current (how many charge passes a given space per second, meassured in ampere).",

So it doesn't do the \"vroooon vroooon\" sound. Some car people like this sound and crap on CVT just for the sound.  Even some cars with CVTs imitate geared transmissons by changing the ratio not continuously but suddenly.  My first car was a CVT Honda Jazz (Fit). Extremely reliable and agile car.

But looking back at the history of that area of Europe in the years between 1815 and 1945, the only war on mainland Europe that could've involved Switzerland was World War 1. Switzerland had not formed any defensive alliances or the like simply because they didn't need to.   Ultimately, the geography of the region kept it safe.   The effort to invade Switzerland would have weakened the attacker too much for little gain. Additionally, the lack of any coast meant no navy, and no colonies to fight over. Thus no reason to get involved in WW1. Same for WW2.  So they kept this pretence of neutrality to deflect any embarrassing questions about their actions during WW2 (cough cough stolen Nazi gold cough), stuck to their guns on it during the cold war, and now everyone thinks Switzerland is a peace loving nation in the middle of a violent continent and always has been.

    "answer": "The other answers talking about your pupils are incorrect, or at least not fully correct. It's true that the pupil changes size to let different amounts of light it, but that just takes a few seconds.   The process of eyes adjusting to the dark has to do with a chemical in the cells of your retina. Your retina (the part of your eye that senses light and sends the signals to your brain) is made up of two types of cells, rods and cones. Cones see in color but don't work if there's not enough light. Rods only see light and dark, but they can sense very small amounts of light.   In the rod cells there's a chemical called rhodopsin that's responsible for absorbing light and turning that into a signal to send to your brain, When a molecule of rhodopsin absorbs light, it breaks apart. When it's very bright out, all of the rhodopsin molecules are being broken apart by all the light. If you suddenly move into the dark, you don't have any rhodopsin left, so the rod cells can't absorb the light. It takes about 30 minutes for the rhodopsin molecules to \"regenerate\" so that the rod cells can absorb fully light again.",

What exactly those adjustments are is complicated, but it probably involves:   Beam forming: by adding up the sound coming though your right and left ear with a slight delay, you can boost the signal to noise ratio of sounds coming from a given direction (though with only two ears it'll be a sort of conical donut shape).   Reverb analysis: your brain has been trained from birth to recognise how the shape of your ear (and the rest of your body for that matter) bounces around sounds coming from different directions and can use this to focus on sounds coming from a specific direction (or more often tell which direction sounds are coming from).   Frequency analysis: if you're listening to two (average, young) women talking to each other, you can ignore all the frequencies not related to human speech or too low for (most) women to use.   Pattern recognition: if you're listening to two people speaking a language you know, your brain can use your knowledge of that language to predict what's most likely to be said next given the context of the conversation so far, and pick whatever word fits most closely to the raw sound your ears are reporting.  At least those are the methods used by computers to do the same thing. Except for the reverb thing, that's still really hard to do for computers while the human brain is absolutely fantastic at it.",

If you factor that cost in, over decades, centuries, and potentially millennia (be honest, you don't really know how long it'll need to be contained), then it is neither cheap nor safe.

However politicians, army and or other groups have interested in nuclear waste being stored safely or for low prices.  > If you factor that cost in, over decades, centuries, and potentially millennia (be honest, you don't really know how long it'll need to be contained)  We know how long to contain it. Plutonium and minor actinides around 1 million years. Fission products around 300. Luckily La hague in france is a reprocessing facility that allows us to actually use plutonium in a nuclear reactor instead of having to wait for 1 million years.  Nature also made a nuclear reactor in the past.  This happened millions of years ago and we have found how far the products of this natural nuclear reactor where found from the uranium. Seeing that this happened in a aquifer and the fission products and minor actinides traveled less than 2 meters from the uranium veins we can conclude that mimicking nature is enough to contain the waste from a nuclear reactor.  > That's why no one wants to build another Chernobyl, 3 Mile Island, or Fukushima in the modern day.  Nobody wants to build infrastructure design with technologies from 40 to 60 years ago. We have had time to iterate on design and work out flaws.

However VVER's, APR's and Chinese design's are being built in 6-8 years, on budget with prospects good enough to build more.   In europe and america they seem to suffer from our inability to build infrastructure. Like how it took germany 15 years instead of 5 to build berlin airport at 3 times the expected cost. Or the fact that rail projects in europe have a average of taking 11 years longer to build than planned at 50% more cost than expected.

    "question": "eli5: What is the intrinsic value of crypto, what will protect it from banks tanking it in their backing, and how is it more than just a literal gamble?",
    "answer": "The value in crypto is because other people value it, and use it as a means of exchange. That's basically it.  Every currency is underpinned by the market it has exclusivity in. For example, people often say the US dollar is not backed in anything, but that's not strictly true. It's backed by the US economy, and the fact that in order to play in the US economy you must use dollars, and you must pay your taxes in dollars. Due to the sheer size of the US economy, the dollar is so powerful that it's used as the de-facto means of exchange worldwide, hence why 90-95% of *all* international trade uses dollars, either directly or indirectly as an intermediate currency (most of that remaining 5-10% are Euros for inter-EU trade, and then Yen which is largely in lockstep with the US Dollar).  For crypto, that market is (at the moment) mainly illicit items that can't really be purchased in real-world currencies because the governments that issue those currencies are the ones who define those items as being illicit in the first place.  However, that's also fundamentally what will likely by the undoing of crypto, at least as we know it. Currently, crypto has a very short list of primary uses ranging the full spectrum of illicit activities, from relatively harmless activities like buying marijuana or pirated music to extremely harmful activities like buying child pornography. But the really two big problems crypto has are due to it's association with money laundering and avoiding economic sanctions, and as a result there's a reason why something on the order of 90% of crypto mining is done in China, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.  Further, should the United States choose to do so, it can pretty easily swat crypto down, as the US government can effectively ban any party from exchanging dollars for crypto, either directly or indirectly, as is shown by sanctions against existing governments. The only reason crypto hasn't been hit *yet* is essentially because it's beneath the notice of Congress and the White House, but it'll only take a single high-profile case facilitated by crypto exchange for the US government to go to town on crypto markets, at which point the value will tank because crypto's already poor liquidity will be effectively frozen. For an example; just think of what happens if/when there is a major terrorist attack in a western country paid for in Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever. The US government *already* locked down on air travel in the wake of 9/11, despite complaints that persist to this day. Just think of what the US government will do when the only people who suffer are seen in the popular zeitgeist as terrorists, kiddy-diddlers, and drug dealers.  In essence; crypto is neither an investment or a store of value. It is a flash in the pan, and a means of short term speculation, but while the technology is neat (and will probably be used legitimately in the future), the current coins are all at the mercy of powerful governmental agencies, and will only survive (and maintain value) so long as they fly under the radar.",

    "answer": "Spectrum analysers often work based on something called the Fast Fourier Transform.  This is a mathematical technique which lets us look at a wave, let's say the sound of a lion's roar, and instead of looking at how it changes over time (like having a loud beginning, slowly getting quieter, and a few grumbles at the end), asking what other waves it is made of.  That feels like a big jump, but it's simpler than you think. Sticking with sound, you may know that the pitch of a sound is determined by something called it's frequency. This is mostly true, but it's not the full picture. Sounds are made up of lots and lots of frequencies all added together. This is what makes a violin sound different to a flute if they're playing the same note. What this means is that if you take a very simple wave which genuinely only has a single frequency, called a sine wave, and start adding very special amounts of other waves of very specific frequencies, you can actually build sounds from scratch - this is called \"additive synthesis\", by the way.  What the Fast Fourier Transform does is tell you exactly what amount of *all* frequencies have gone into making whatever wave it's looking at. This is sometimes called a \"decomposition\", because it is looking at what the wave is composed of.  Why is it associated with ghost hunters? Because they need some bullshit to hook people's attention and these things look cool and technical and a good storyteller can make a story out of it.",

For example, antlers, fighting, if the guy has big antlers and can win fights with those antlers, it means he had a healthy year and is probably big and strong, desirable things.  Or for bright plumage on make birds, make birds may have bright plumage for multiple reason. The first that it again shows you\u2019re healthy, you need to be healthy and eating well to have really nice bright feathers. Bright plumage also can attract predators, which may have two purposes, first being that if you\u2019re a male, the predators will see you more, so you need to be stronger/faster/smarter to survive. But another point is that for birds, the female will often sit on the nest and try to remain hidden if a predator is nearby, while the male will get out away from the nest and chirp loudly trying to draw the predators attention away from the nest.",
    "follow-up": "I never understood the handicap theory (colourful birds must be fitter to survive predators). Doesn't the fact that your offspring will be in more danger (because they'll inherit the colours) offset the benefit of being fitter?

I like the drawing away predators explanation but it seems a bit like jumping without a parachute: it only works once.

But at the same time, it motivate the employee to make the company succeed as it increase the value of the shares and therefore the employee's income. So investors agree to have a little bit of that, typically, the higher up the hierarchy, the higher amount of your salary is in share form.  Every year the company will have a shareholder meeting where this kind of \"budget\" are voted. If you hold shares you can vote.  But the truth with shares (and that's why it's so hard to tax) is that they don't really have a monetary value until you try to sell them.

    "answer": "Blood is pumped by the heart through continually splitting and shrinking blood vessels until it is basically oozing through tissue and tiny capillaries. Afterwards there are return vessels that collect the blood from the capillaries and tissues to be returned to the heart, but the pressure in these vessels is much lower. Think about blood which has flowed through tissues in the legs, how will it get back up the heart when the pressure from the heart is behind all that slow-flowing tissue blood?  There are various mechanisms that help this including one-way valves in the legs that close off to avoid backflow of blood, allowing it to sort of ratchet its way back up to the torso. But another helpful factor is that the powerful leg muscles are continually contracting and squeezing the vessels as they do their job of balancing us as we stand or walk. Locking the legs takes most of the strain off the leg muscles and allows them to relax, which is what someone in a band formation might want for example, but it also removes that helpful blood pushing effect.  So when someone locks their legs it makes it harder for blood to be returned to the heart which in turn will generally drop blood pressure overall, reducing the amount that can make it to the brain. If someone is on the edge already this can be enough to push them into fainting.",

It radiates in all visible colors. And indeed, astronomers have done this, and that is what we see.  But we live on Earth. At the bottom of an ocean of air. That air messes with the light as it passes through.  Have you ever wondered why the sky is blue? Air particles like to scatter light. Knock it off its direct path and send it careening off in a new random direction. But it likes to do this to bluish light more than the other colors. That bluish light that gets knocked off course  in random parts of the sky may be sent on a path that hits your eye. Since that is how you detect blue things, the sky looks blue.  That blue light had to come from somewhere, though. Direct sunlight going into your eye has this happening to it, too. But instead of light going a random direction having the bluish parts knocked in your direction, we have the opposite. Direct sunlight is having the bluish colors knocked away. The light that finally reaches you will be slightly blue light depleted, making the sun appear somewhat yellowish.  At sunrise and sunset, the sun is clipping your part of the earth at a low angle, meaning its light has to pass through way more air.

    "answer": "There are a lot of objects in the night sky we can't see with the naked eye (that's why there are telescopes). It doesn't matter about the size of the object, but rather the intensity of its light at the spot of observation.   Since stars are spherical, the intensity of light is inversely proportional to the distance squared. Basically meaning, if youre close to the Sun, you get a lot more light hitting your eye than if you were farther away, since the light spreads out as is travels. Think of a penny on an inflating balloon. At a smaller radius, theres more material under the penny but if you blow it up more and more (as light travels through space) there's less and less under the penny. At some point, the light spreads out enough for our eyes to not be able to capture enough of it to detect the source. But all of the stars we can see are bright enough and close enough to be visible.   If I have a lazer and stand on the moon and shine towards your eye, will you be able to see the lazer itself? No. But if it's bright enough, you'll be able to see the light that it's emitting.

    "answer": "If you're taking an introductory chemistry class, further research is going to be confusing because they tell us little lies in early chemistry to aid in our understanding. They clear it up in more advanced classes. For example, intro chemistry 101 says the protons of atoms never change.. a semester or 2 later you learn about nuclear radiation and proton emissions   Are you doing electron configuration with different shells?   think of spin as another dimension electrons move in. Remember the orbitals are electron clouds, its where you have the best chance of finding the electron, its not a rigid path. If you just need to understand to complete assignments, just remember spin directions must oppose in the same orbital/shell.. one up, one down, and so on.. electrons are negatively charged so they ALWAYS repel eachother.   Also, electrons are so small that they do not follow the laws of physics as you and I follow them. Talking about electrons goes extremely deep, people base entire degrees and careers on electrons and the theories get extremely complex.  If I knew what classes you're taking I feel I could give you a better direction.. but consider this, my answer and your question are about subatomic particles, things going *within* a single atom/Molecule.

    "question": "ELI5: What is, really, the spin of an electron?",
    "answer": "Any system have angular momentum, around a pivot of choice. Spin is just angular momentum of a particle when considered alone.  Angular momentum are *not* the L=r x v from classical Newtonian mechanics. Instead, we define angular momentum by their main defining characteristic: it is preserved under all continuous rotations. The classical Newtonian angular momentum is a formula that give you a preserved quantity, assuming Newtonian physics is correct. But once we move into the weirder realm of quantum mechanics, we have to abandon the formula and stick with the most important property, the fact that it's preserved under continuous rotations.  Given an arbitrary axis (this axis is normally named z), we can talk about angular momentum around this axis. This is a measurable number that is preserved under all continuous rotations around that axis. Due to funky issue with quantum physics, you can't actually talk about angular momentum around all axis at the same time, because trying to measure this number around one axis disrupt the rest; in fact it's not even possible to talk angular momentum about 2 axes at the same time. However, you can talk about magnitude squared of total angular momentum (when you consider rotation around ALL axis), which IS a number that can be measured.  Without loss of generality, we can assume that we do have a special z-axis where angular momentum exist, because this allows us to have an additional number to identify an electron: the secondary spin number.  If you consider one single particle by itself, this angular momentum give you the spin number, and the angular momentum around one specific z-axis give you the secondary spin number. For an electron, the spin number is fixed to be 1/2, so really you only care about secondary spin number. If you assume that there exist angular momentum around the z-axis, this 1/2 spin number - which tell you angular momentum - limit the possible value of angular momentum around the z-axis. By choosing 1 direction to be called \"up\" (associated with positive number) and the other direction \"down\", we have 2 values +1/2 and -1/2. But warning: this \"up\" and \"down\" don't have any actual geometric meaning, they are merely analogy from classical Newtonian mechanics where angular momentum is represented by a vector that can actually point up or down.  When you consider an atom together with an electron, the whole system itself have a different number that are also angular momentum (of the system). This is called total angular momentum. The electron, when considered alone, have its own angular momentum which is called spin. Subtracting the spin number from the total angular momentum give you orbital angular momentum. Since electron all have the same spin number, you only need orbital angular momentum and secondary spin number if you want to distinguish electrons by angular momentum.",

When skin gets irritated or suffers from an infection it can go into overdrive so instead of just losing a little bit at a time you can lose it in huge clumps. Have you ever gotten a sun burn so bad your skin was peeling? That's because the skin underneath is going into overdrive repair mode and instead of little bits of dead skin breaking off in tiny almost microscopic amounts, you have huge clumps of it that are easily visible.  Same thing for your scalp. On almost every adult is a yeast-like organism that munches on the oils of your hair. If it gets out of balance it can irritate your skin and that can cause it to shed skin in larger clumps that we call dandruff.

As someone else has explained, without blood vessels to deliver the necessary components and take away the debris, no repairs can happen. Adding some blood components may help somewhat, but it is the equivalent of airdropping a few truckloads of materials onto a construction site instead of having a road for trucks to constantly come in and out of. It will kind of allow some repair to happen, but it is not efficient.   The other problem is a lot harder to solve. Cartilage is mostly made of extracellular components, not live cells. When you were developing, cartilage making cells produced all those materials and left them there, but as the cells deposit the material that makes cartilage they end up trapping themselves inside of it. To go back to the construction site analogy, cells are the workers that take the materials and actually build something useful. It is useless to have all the needed materials but no workers to build with them, so even with adding all necessary components, if there's not enough cells left, nothing will get repaired. You could try adding some stem cells, but they can't travel through the solid cartilage, and so repairing parts that are not easily accessible or visible is not practical this way.",

    "question": "ELI5 Electronic solder alloys ratios?",
    "answer": "Solder is a eutectic mixture which means it has a property better than any of its components.  Leaded solder (commonly 63% lead, 37% tin) will melt at 183C while Lead melts at 327C and Tin melts at 232C so that's a big drop.  You can tweak the melting point and some strength parameters by adjusting the mix but there are a few happy points.  A common lead free solder is SAC 305 which is 97% tin, 3% silver, and 0.5% copper, the mix of metals helps give it the right properties  The ideal mixture comes down to how everything interacts to form little metallic crystals  When you solder something its not like glue where there's material A, layer of glue, material B, there's actually an interface layer.  If you're soldering a copper wire to a gold pad there will be gold, layer of gold/tin/other solder bits that transition from pure gold to pure solder, then layer of solder, then tin/copper/solder mix as it bonds to the wire, then just the copper wire.  Its this \"intermetallic\" layer where the solder and the material being connected have created a new alloy that makes the joints strong.  For lead free solder, mixing a tiny bit of silver in results in a better crystal structure than just tin with a bit of copper would",

    "question": "ELI5: What is the gamey flavor we associate with non traditional meats like elk, bison, boar, etc?",
    "answer": "\"Meat\" isn't just muscle flesh from an animal.  There is a very rapid aging process that occurs in meat shortly after an animal dies.  Depending on the animal's health and stress level at the time it died, you end up with with one of three outcomes:  1) PSE meat, which is light colored and spongy  2) Normal meat, which is the stuff you find in your supermarket  3) DFD meat, which is dark, tough, and has the \"gamey\" taste people associate with non-traditional animals.  The taste itself is the result of the meat being less acidic than normal meat.  Animals killed on a large, commercial farm will be in good health and are killed instantly, so that the animal doesn't experience any stress while dying.  This results in mostly normal meat being produced from their carcasses.  There will be some PSE and DFD meat but it either gets turned into pet food or thrown out.  When people go out and hunt meat they're killing animals that are typically in poor health and/or which are under a lot of stress (if for no other reason than that getting shot and slowly bleeding to death is stressful).  This almost always produces DFD meat.  Because people associate game animals with the gamey taste of DFD meat, some ranches that grow those animals commercially will deliberately produce DFD meat to maintain the gamey taste that people expect.    But if you were to kill a game animal in the same manner as a domestic animal (IE, killing it instantaneously when at peak physical condition) then it would taste pretty similar to the meat from domestic animals.",

Off the cuff, maybe it was related to the ability to hear an animal in the brush, determine its direction and look/plan for an intercept course to hunt it down? IDK though, I've not seen it directed towards planes in other dogs I've had but have seen the here an animal in the woods and scan ahead quite a few times.

All energy in the universe is finite and tends toward universal equilibrium, but in the process it \u201cbounces around\u201d interacting with mass to heat it up, move it, or encourage a chemical reaction. In biochemical energy we refer to a chemical called adenosine triphosphate. Just like the name implies, there are three phosphate groups chained together in this compound. This is not an ideal thing because everything wants to be at the lowest energy level it can be relative to the environment. For ATP this means it really wants to jettison off one phosphate group and become ADP. It needs a little help doing this, and will give off a decent amount of energy  in doing so. When a chemical reaction uses ATP as fuel, the energy released by helping it lower to a more stable compound is used to do *work*. In this case, the work could be something like moving atoms in a compund, breaking bonds, or providing the **umph**  to get certain things to bond.",

    "answer": "When you deposited gold in a bank, they would give you a receipt. Trading actual gold coins is difficult, because they're heavy, it's hard to make change etc. so what people started doing was trading was just trading the receipts instead. That's what paper currency was you accepted it as payment knowing you could always go and get the gold if you really wanted it. So they pegged the dollar to gold, at a ratio of $20 per ounce, and well that was that.  The gold standard fell apart after WW1 and WW2 because governments basically committed fraud. They printed more receipts for gold than they had actual gold, and used this counterfeit money to fund the war efforts.   So that fell apart. Bretton Woods was an attempt to sort of patch up the gold standard, while placing America in a very advantageous position. What had happened at the end of WW2 is that America was holding most of everyone's gold, because European countries had sent it to the US for safe keeping. So what the Americans did was establish the dollar as a sort of default one world currency. Every other country would measure their currency against the dollar, and the US government would peg the dollar to the gold they were holding, at a ratio of I think $40 per ounce.  And that fell apart because the US government basically committed fraud. Again. They printed more dollars than they had actual gold, so that $40 ratio did not hold and eventually in 1971 President Nixon just abolished it entirely. Since then every country has sort of pegged their currency to the dollar, but the dollar itself is pegged to nothing.  The point of a gold standard was to keep people honest. If you can legally just print all of the money you want, then you're just going to print and print and print. If anyone else does it they go to jail but it's OK when governments do it, apparently. But if there's a gold standard, it means you have one objective yard stick that we all use, and you cannot spend money you don't use.   It's a nice idea but ultimately it doesn't work because they always print more dollars than they have gold in the vaults to back it up.",

    "answer": "Electric generators and motors can use dc or ac, not both.  DC generators and motors need brushes to catch the power from the spinning part, and this brushes require big big maintenance. When AC was discovered, it allowed to make generators and motors at 2/3 of the price of a DC one, and they are completely maintenance free, because they don\u2019t need a brush system. So they won, and were adopted in mass.  Not having brushes allows to produce higher voltages without issues. Higher voltage allows to  transfer the same power using thinner wires, this makes transport and the generator parts to be done with thin cheaper wires, saving even more money.  Then the power transport in cables has losses along the line, electrons flow heats the cables, with high voltage, you can transport power by moving fewer electrons but with higher force in each of them. So again, another win for high voltage systems, and again high voltage production is easier if done in AC. There are DC high voltage lines, for example, submarine cables and nation to nation lines may be high voltage DC; not so common but it\u2019s done sometime, for example, a country with 115v 50hz AC may transform it to DC to sell it to another country that then transforms it into its own 220V 60hz AC. This is done because the 2 different AC systems are completely incompatible, because both need to transform it, they may have a DC line between them.  Add in that illumination can be done with DC or AC without difference.   Basically the only drawback for AC is computers. Computers need low voltage DC. So we use an AC line for everything, and transform it to low voltage DC only in the devices that need it. Another thing that can\u2019t work in AC are batteries, so any system that has a battery needs to be DC. This doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t do a AC system with a DC conversion between system and battery, sometime it\u2019s done, it\u2019s overly expensive but may be done.",

    "question": "ELI5 Why are some math problems unsolved?",
    "answer": "Try this: choose any positive integer. If it's odd, then multiply by 3 and add 1. If it's even, then divide by 2. Repeat.  So, for example, if we start with 5:  5 = 3*5+1 = 16  16 = 16/2 = 8  8 = 8/2 = 4  4 = 4/2 = 2  2 = 2/2 = 1  1 = 3*1+1 = 4  Notice how we have entered a loop of 4->2->1.  The Collatz conjecture states that any positive integer you choose will enter this loop. Prove if this conjecture is true or false.",
    "follow-up": "I don't get why this needs proof :/  No matter how long the number is, multiplying by 3 then adding 1 will *always* make the last digit an even number.  Dividing it may make it a prime number, but then that gets changed to even which may become a prime number again but will eventually get to an even number that continues to divide multiple times. Notice the following: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1  3 -> *10* -> **5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1**  **5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1**  *7* -> 22 -> 11 -> 34 -> 17 -> 52 -> 26 -> 13 -> **40** -> 20 -> *10*  9 -> 28 -> 14 -> *7*  See how they all tie in to each other which will eventually make it 1.   Look at what's being done and ask yourself, is there any number that can't be divided by 2? Yes. Odd numbers, so we're making them even. Which now makes it divisible by 2.  Great thing about math is you can always reverse it. Can we multiply anything by 2?  Yes. Every number can be multiplied by 2.  What happens when you take even numbers and subtract by 1? Your new number is either divisible by 3, or it's not. So we have 2 cases: If the number is divisible by 3, divide by 3. If the number would not be divisible by 3, add the 1 back in then multiply by 2. There's no positive number in existence that can't be multiplied by 2 or subtracted by 1, then divided by 3 or have the 1 added back in and multiplied by 2 if it's not divisible by 3.  With both conditions being true, the questions are: Is there any number in existence that can not be reached by multiplying another whole number by 2? Yes, odd numbers. So last question, is there any odd number in existence that can't be reached by taking another number and subtracting 1 then dividing by 3? Nope. Because every number can be multiplied by 3 then have 1 added to it.  Every positive whole number has been accounted for going up, so the reverse must be true as well.  No need to check billions of numbers, the logic shows it to be true.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why can some electric plugs (US) go in an outlet \"backwards\" and some not?",
    "answer": "It's actually why you're told not to stick a fork in a toaster!   Electricity has a \"direction\". Think of it like a water hose. Water goes in one end and comes out of the other end.   One side of the plug is the \"hot\" side, that's how electricity gets in to your device. The other side is the \"neutral\" side. That's how electricity gets out of your device.   To some extent it doesn't matter which way the plug is plugged in. If you plug a toaster in the \"wrong\" way it will still work. This is just like a water hose, if you put it on \"backwards\" it still works. Some electronics may be damaged if you do this, but there's a better reason why these plugs are built this way.  The right way for electricity to flow through a toaster is from the \"hot\" wire to a switch. If that switch is \"closed\" (you've turned the toaster on), electricity keeps going through the toaster and heats up the heating elements, then leaves through the neutral wire. If you have the plug turned this way and the switch is \"open\" (the toaster is not on), you can stick a fork in the toaster safely because the electricity has stopped at the switch. There is no electricity in the heating elements because the neutral wire is the \"out\" wire.   But if you plug the toaster in the other way, electricity flows from the hot side of your outlet through the neutral wire, into the heating elements, then it hits the switch. It can't actually make the toaster heat up because that takes a flow of electricity. But if you put a fork in the toaster, that fork forms a path from the hot wire to the ground through your arm, body, leg, and foot. You become the switch and turn on the toaster. That's bad news.  Same thing with lamps. If it's plugged in hot-to-hot, the switch is why you can safely change a bulb. If it's hot-to-neutral, you might get shocked if you're not super careful.   So modern devices usually have this kind of plug. It's called a \"polarized\" plug, which is a sort of misuse of that word. In a general sense it means it \"has a direction\". This ensures you don't accidentally plug a device in a way that's unsafe. But not all devices have a way to stick a fork inside or a switch to stop electrical flow, so those devices might use an unpolarized plug. For example, I don't think my laptop charger's polarized. But I also have no clue how the heck to open it, so by the time I stick a fork in it I've already made at least four other bad decisions and it's not Apple's fault.",

    "answer": "The top 1% of taxpayers in the US account for 20% of the country's income and 40% of the country's taxes.  That ratio is consistent with what you would expect given the tax rates in the country.  Typically people who say that someone isn't paying taxes don't understand how taxes work.  Specifically, neither people nor corporations are taxed on revenue - everyone is only taxed on *income*, which is the amount of money you have left over to spend on yourself.  For low wealth individuals nearly 100% of the money you make is income because the only cost involved in you making money is your time.  But for high wealth individuals and corporations that isn't true.  If you have to pay someone else $100 so that they can earn you $150 then it doesn't make any sense to take you on that $150 in revenue, it only makes sense to tax you on the $50 in income that you actually made.    If you do tax on revenue then all you do is create a situation where people can't afford to both pay taxes and hire employees.  Imagine if you have to pay someone $100 to make $101.  If you get taxed on that $101 of revenue then you end up losing money on that, so no one would do it and its rare for anyone to have a profit margin higher than a few percent.  What this means is that just because someone or something has huge revenue doesn't mean that they have much income.  That is, just because Company X is making $50 billion per year doesn't mean that it has $50 billion per year to distribute to shareholders.  In reality it has far less than that, and its that disposable income that the company gets taxed on.  This makes for good headlines but, again, actual tax receipts in the US more or less match their expected distribution based on the current tax rates.",

Why do they want you to look at a screen? You may ask.  Advertising.  Companies want to make money, and in order to do this they need to let people know about their products. But advertising your products costs a lot of money when you are trying to reach a wider audience.  So they target specific demographics.  Where before, they would've advertised on a certain website, or in a certain area, advertisers can now target specific people. People they know like the kind of things they are selling. People of a particular age and gender who like to purchase products similar to yours.  By targeting more specifically, they have more chance of making a sale per dollar spent on advertising. So companies who harvest data from us sell it to 3rd party advertisers.

It's an incredibly complex issue and frankly it's concerning to see many people on reddit oversimplify it. Hell, I'm oversimplifying it now because there's countless minutia involved as well (state by state, international expansion, etc), but the answer isn't simply \"grr they're evil and hiding their money somewhere!\"",

    "answer": "So when you're a seed in torrent swarm it means you have 100% of the torrent file(s). This means that anybody else wanting to download the file can download from you.  A torrent will have both seeds (people with 100% downloaded), and leachers (everybody else). Leachers will download from other leachers file fragments that have high availability, but potentially there's only certain files, or file pieces that can only be sourced from a seed at any given point.  If a torrent stream eventually has no seed then it's possible that nobody else currently downloading the file will be able to reach 100%.  In short, yes, seed out your torrents.",

    "question": "Eli5: Why is data so valuable to companies?",
    "answer": "Data can be used to optimize processes and predict behaviour. The former can lead to significant cost-cutting while the latter can increase sales. On top of that, data can reveal far more than people are willing to share or are even aware of.  For example, most shops are franchises. And most franchises are owned by umbrella corporations or multinationals. That means those corporations can collect data on their customers across a wide variety of stores.  Let's say I have a customer discount card for a supermarket, a clothing store and a drug store all owned by the same corporation. There are hundreds of thousands or even millions of people like me who all shop at those same stores.  Those cards let stores track my purchases. And if I start buying diapers regularly, it's reasonable to assume I had a baby recently.  So if you compare my current shopping pattern over the last 9 months to my shopping pattern over the last two years, you can see how my behaviour changed during my pregnancy.  I stopped drinking alcohol. I changed my meals. I started taking different vitamins. I started buying different kinds of clothes. There are countless clues to my shopping behaviour really.  If you collect this data on thousands or even millions of women that you know are pregnant. You can start identify indicators that very accurately predict which customers are pregnant even though they haven't told you.  Now you can change the advertising you serve these customers with to be specifically targeted at pregnancy-related products. This is much more relevant to their interests than untargeted advertising and as such, more likely to be successful.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg really. Big data analysis can very accurately predict a staggering variety of qualities like sexuality, age, gender, political and cultural leanings and so on.  It works so well that it can accurately predict behavioural factors the person themselves isn't even aware of. Ie. a person might think and say they're fairly liberal but their behaviour indicates that they're much more conservative than they think and as such more sensitive to conservative-leaning messages.  Simply put, your personal behavioural data is more honest about you than you're willing to be, even to yourself. And when you can collect data like that on millions, you start to understand people at a level that people don't even understand themselves or each other.  And with that kind of information, you can craft incredibly powerful manipulation.",

    "answer": "When you say or think of a word (for example, \u201cpink\u201d), it creates a sensation in your brain. That sensation is electric impulses traveling from neuron to neuron in a specific, complex network that your brain accepts and registers as \u201cpink\u201d. However, during the travel of the electric impulse, your neurons release certain chemicals, and those chemicals need to be restored. This is known as \u201creuptake.\u201d  Thus, when you first think \u201cpink,\u201d all the neurons used to create that thought are all strong and ready to give you a nice, strong, comprehensive, and clear idea of pink. However, after immediately triggering those neurons over and over and over, while your neurons are still in the reuptake process, they get, \u201ctired out\u201d in a way, and aren\u2019t all able to perform as expected.   Duly note; neurons firing is like a gun firing; they either do or don\u2019t. They can\u2019t half fire and create a weak image. Instead, the idea of pink gets less and less clear as less and less neurons are working to create the image until they all \u201cpass out\u201d and you\u2019re left thinking \u201c...what IS pink?\u201d",

If you touched your fingertip to a bacterial culture and then left your hands and arms fixed in place for a long time, you're forearms wouldn't be contaminated with that bacteria for a long, long time if ever.  The issue is that bacteria and other pathogens become airborne easily (they're really, really small and light - a slight disturbance can make them airborne), so when you \"do something manky\" you've almost certainly had some of the manky germs end up on your forearms (and face and shirt and lots of other places).  Also, you probably touch your arms and face and legs and los of other parts with those manky hands far more and far more often than you realize, spreading germs by direct touch.  When you wash up, you're not trying to remove every trace of germs from every part that may have been exposed, you're just trying to significantly reduce the number of pathogens on the parts of your body most likely to have larger concentration (like hands), which are generally the parts that come into contact with food (if you're a cook), patients (if you're in health care), etc.  Scrubbing up to the elbows is a best practice because it does help reduce pathogens on your hands generally without a significant increase in time and effort - since you're already at the sink washing your hands, it's no big deal to use a bit more soap and scrub up a bit higher.",

Chemical elements, on the other hand, tend to absorb particular colors.

(Think of a planet's atmosphere as being sort of like a stained-glass window.  Even though we've only got a single pixel of light, if we know what colors *could* be in the window, we can figure out how many panes of each color it must have in order to produce the pixel that we're seeing.)

    "answer": "As a reformed project manager (not civil): unlike in some fields like maybe software, or in infrastructure projects where more of the entire project is _entirely_ under you control (say in building an airport or erecting a new chemical refinery), civil projects have SOOO many pieces going on. And quite a few of them are NOT under your control.   If you work for BP and you're building a new refinery, you've done your environmental compliance assessment, you've lined up your contractors years in advance, you own the land and you don't care about the interruption to your other facilities - you've already dealt with it to as to not interrupt. And if your workers have to go the long way around, well, you're just paying them overtime. THe only one affected is you/your corporation.   Civil projects: well you gotta have public consultations, you have to re-route utilities, redirect traffic, do site work and thousands of other things _before you sink a shovel_. AND, all the things to reverse this are scheduled to happen AFTER the bridge is done. If ANYTHING goes wrong with the actual bridge building, everything gets thrown for a loop. Bus line 207 got re-routed but was scheduled to resume over the bridge next week? The re-route requires six additional bussess per shift, that's six extra drivers, six extra busses. They're needed to backfill the south boulevard re-route because of the new sewer on Ocean st. in a week. If the bridge project takes longer now I need six MORE buses and drivers. Oh and you have no direct control over this, this is the transit planner and they don't like you by the way.   So, you can mitigate a lot of these by having contingnecy plans. But those require resources to be reserved and allocated all of which costs money. I can plan you a project that comes in on schedule but if it has to be able to absorb any and all possibilities itll cost you - you probably won't like it.   A good example: my city was laying a railway underpass. Every day the rail line was disrupted cost the city $XXXXXX.  They're pouring concrete in Febuary... in Canada. The weather was forecast to be good for _that particular week_, but below a certain temperature concrete doesn't set right or it cracks or something (I dunno, Im not civil). So to protect the pour they threw up a big heated tent large enough for the machines and shotcrete trucks. Cost like $1.2M. Oh my god did the peons have a field day with _that_. Never mind that had the bridge not been completed on time (and if the concrete doesn't pour correctly you have to do it over. All of it.) the city would have been paying the railway like $100k per day or more. So $1.2M to protect against what could have been much more than that... seems like a deal to me.   So yeah. Civil projects are a balance between cost and what the city can afford, minimizing interactions with other government departments, minimizing disruption to people, business and traffic. There's lots of communication and inter-dependency and if _anything_ goes wrong (heaven forbid your archeology survey didn't catch an indigenous burial ground) everything else falls apart or falls into some very expensive contingency plans.",

We already have these pipelines in place for other facets of our product, all we had to do was clone any one of them and change the variables.  That was over a year ago. I've scarcely written a line of real product code in that amount of time. These automated tools are supposed to help us, make the process easier. Over. A. Year. I can run the commands manually on my workstation and produce the product from scratch in 3 minutes, 25 seconds. Our pipelines take ~6 hours to run, and we've never gotten them to run stable, they always fail.  I've got a guy who is in a dev/ops role. Took him over 8 months to get approved the hardware he spec'd for the job. He just needed the guy to look at the sheet and say yes. Once he got the hardware, he had to hand it over to another team who would do a custom install. That was 6 months ago. Just install the fucking software. My guy bought a mouse jiggler to \"stay active\" at work. There is no amount of shouting he can do to change things, this is how they've operated for over the last decade. They know it's a problem. These are things he's in no position to do himself.  Also in my experience, I've worked at places where sales are pushing me hard for an answer of \"when is it going to be ready?\" I never give an answer besides, \"It's done when it's done. And when it's done, you'll know.\" So they come back, \"So like 3 weeks?\" No, man, no. So then they go and tell the client 3 weeks. That day comes, and the work ain't done. Often we're dealing with massively complex code bases. I've worked on the dumbest shit that was hundreds of millions of lines of code - principally because it's just so poorly constructed. I had a junior reproduce the functionality of a product completely, including all future plans for the product, in 2 weeks during his lunch break. He rewrote the whole thing in Python. Everyone got fired for that. I told them for 5 years the code base was so bad, that would happen. No one listens to me... Anyway, sales guy comes back and says \"Where is it? You said 3 weeks.\" NO, MOTHERFUCKER, YOU SAID THREE WEEKS. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU HAVE TO TELL THE CLIENT. It's like opening a can of worms. The complexity is such that you've got to figure out how to patch in the change without breaking everything else, it's not trivial, and you can't \"just change it\". Otherwise, I would have rewritten that one app in 2 weeks and NOT see our entire team fired for it...  So much spit and glue, man. No software is on time. Ever. People start writing code before they have any idea what they're aiming for. Requirements change continually, so software is always an evolution, not a targeted, well defined product.  It's no surprise to me at all that Boeing had software problems with their new airplanes that killed people. What surprises me unto no end is that this doesn't happen more often. Interlocks on MRI and x-ray machines... All sorts of life support and safety systems that are controlled by software. I don't personally know a single developer, not one colleague across my whole career, who owns a Nest, or a Ring, or any sort of smart device. You know why? Because you don't have to boot a mercury switch. Your analog thermostat will never crash. An analog thermostat will never fail, and it'll be the last one you buy for that house.

    "answer": "So essentially, in the ocean and seas, water is constantly evaporating.  When it evaporates, it's mostly salt free, as the salt doesn't go with water vapor.  It turns into clouds as it gathers together, then goes inland and rains.  Man made desalination works similar.  Except accelerated and in a much smaller surface area.  We heat up the water.  That causes it to evaporate quickly, and we collect the water vapor, and get fresh water.    The residue of the man made desalination process is very salty water.  Which gets pumped back into the ocean, and can cause issues with the area it gets pumped into getting too salty and killing off everything.  The limitation is cost.  It takes a huge amount of energy to heat up water to produce enough fresh water to be usable.  That huge amount of energy is very expensive.",

If reintroducing it back into the ocean it disturbs the flora and fauna, could we not just make a huge inland sea into a desert without an outflow point, similarly to the Dead Sea?",

And when materials burn they emit different wavelengths of light based on their composition (called their \u201cEmission Spectra\u201d).  But planets are different.  They don\u2019t burn.

The specifics of each individual program would lead to more concrete answers.  At a high level, though:  - It might raise prices, but economics is more complex than that.  If there are more buyers in the market for a static number of goods, prices will rise.  However, that rise in prices will lead to new sellers entering the market, driving prices down.  Eventually, these forces will come to equilibrium - probably a bit more expensive than before, but not at an unreasonable level.  - The idea is that everyone gets the UI check regardless.  You can still earn a wage, though, and that wage would be taxed.

I remember in the 90s that having a 6 cylinder vs a 4 cylinder engine made a genuine difference in how safe you felt accelerating up to highway speed.  4 cylinder obviously more fuel efficient, but it was so slow getting up to 70-80mph that it was scary for something some people have to do on a daily commute. My mother would swear them off as death traps on a highway.  These days though, 4 cylinders are plenty fast enough for highway acceleration and are still way more fuel efficient than a 6.  So are smaller engines getting more powerful for similar fuel consumption? Maybe not significant difference in MPG, but a high MPG engine is way more powerful than it used to be.",
    "follow-up": ">So are smaller engines getting more powerful for similar fuel consumption?  Yes and no.  What's been really improving is our capability to force feed smaller engines with more air, which means more gas, which means more power.  When a smaller engine is generating more power, it's generally not doing so any more efficiently than before (there are exceptions). However, when a smaller engine is making a little power, like when you're just cruising on the highway, it's typically much more efficient than the larger engine making that same power. So if a 2L inline 4 cylinder engine and a 3L V6 both make 300hp they're probably using just as much gas *when making 300hp*, but the 2L I4 will use \u00be the gas as the V6 to make the ~80hp you need on the highway.  So how to make smaller, more efficient engines make more power? We force feed tiny engines with more air! It's called supercharging. From the mid-80s through the late '90s we figured out how to do this with the exhaust (look up exhaust gas scavenging - it's like making a musical instrument out of your exhaust! Actually Yamaha, who dabbled in both musical instruments and engine design, were masters at this), which is convenient because it doesn't need any extra parts. Just fancy exhaust headers. These days we figured out how to make turbocharging reliable, which uses an extra air pump spun up by exhaust gasses to pump more air into the intake. This way, that 2L inline 4 cylinder engine can actually pump as much air as the 3L V6 that doesn't have a turbo. And in the end, it's the quantity of air you can pump that determines how powerful an engine can be.",

    "question": "ELI5: How is electricity physically measured (like at the meter on my house)?",
    "answer": "Maybe not ELI5, but here you go.  Electricity is the flow of electrons.   Electrons flow because they are pushed by a *voltage*. The voltage is like the pressure causes water to flow in a pipe.  The amount of electrons that flow is termed the *current*. The current is like the flowrate of water in the pipe.  More voltage (pressure) = more current (flow).  So if you want to talk about flow, you might say there are 10 electrons travelling past a point every second (electrons per second), just like how you might talk about water flow in litres or gallons per second.  If you want to find the total volume of water, you take the flow and multiply it by time. So if you had 10 litres per second, after 100 seconds you used 10\u00d7100=1000 litres.  Same for electricity. You take the amperage, and multiply it by time. We could do electrons per second, but we use Amperes to measure current. We also use hours instead of seconds.  So what do you get when you multiply Amperes and Hours? Ampere-hour (Ah), which is what you see on your electricity bill. The ampere-hour is the amount of electricity you used.  Now we know how you measure time, but what about current?  Inside your meter is a *current transformer*. This consists of a metal donut that surrounds the main conductor going into your house. A copper wire is coiled around the donut.  The electricity going through the main conductor is AC (*alternating current*). Now when electricity flows, it creates a magnetic field. When that current *alternates*, so does the magnetic field. So you have an *alternating magnetic field* surrounding the main conductor. This fluctuating magnetic field causes magnetic field lines to pass through that copper coil in your little current transformer, and that *induces* a small current in the copper coil.  This copper coil is connected to a smarter device which includes an ammeter which measures the current. This is then used to calculate the current in the main conductor.  The current \u00d7 time calculation is done at small intervals and added together to account for varying loads.",

What it actually refers to is a combination of pain medicine and sedation medicine that are used to keep people calm and comfortable while they have a breathing tube in.   Second, this \u201ccoma\u201d or state of sedation isn\u2019t done to treat the overdose itself. It is done again to allow for uncomfortable medical interventions such as a breathing tube and possibly cooling (targeted temperature management).  When he overdosed, his breathing became so slow and shallow and he did not get enough oxygen and he could not blow out carbon dioxide. When the heart doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen it will stop beating. When the brain doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen for long enough, it causes brain damage (anoxic brain injury).   CPR is used to circulate blood as we try to restart the heart with medication and/or shocks.  A breathing tube is placed to breath for the patient until they can breath on their own.  When a patient has cardiac/respiratory arrest, they almost always have some amount of brain damage, unless high quality CPR was started immediately. We keep them on ventilators (breathing machine connected to the breathing tube that goes down his throat) because the brain damage means he likely wont be able to breath on his own for a while. In many cases after cardiac arrest we also \u201ccool\u201d the patient. This means bringing down their body temperature low enough that it slows metabolism by brain cells and can possibly reduce long term brain damage.  In the next couple days, they will try turning down the sedation to see if he wakes up and evaluate how his brain is functioning (called a sedation vacation). If he does wake up, they will also try a spontaneous breathing trial- turning the ventilator off briefly to see if he is able to breath on his own. If he passes both of those they may be able to take the breathing tube out, and if not they will keep it and try again the next day.",

    "question": "eli5: How does patents work?",
    "answer": "Patents are a way to make sure that if you invent something new, you have the exclusive right to make money off of it for some time. In return, you have to publish all of the details of your invention so that after your time is over, other people can use it, compete with you, and perhaps improve upon it.  To get a patent, you have to make a document that describes your invention in detail. The invention has to meet a lot of criteria, but to oversimplify the patent examiners have to decide your invention looks unique \"enough\". The rules about what that means are pretty complicated, and some people's entire careers are devoted to that!  Once you have the patent, for some number of years you are the ONLY person allowed to make and sell the invention. You can license that right to other people if you want, but the point is YOU control that invention for a time and for someone to use it, they have to have your blessing. The number of years can be different depending on what kind of patent you have. If someone else makes the same thing or even something very similar, you have a right to sue them for patent infringement.   After the period is over, anyone can read your patent document and make the invention and you no longer have the right to sue them. If you want to keep being the only person with that invention, you have to find some way to make a new version worthy of a new patent, but you still can't stop people from making and selling the old one.   This is different from copyrights and trademarks. To compare and contrast with oversimplifications:  * **Copyright** is not something you apply for, it's granted the moment you produce a copyrightable work (typically some kind of art). Other people can't copy your copyrighted material without your permission, though there are some very complicated \"fair use\" laws that allow people to use tiny pieces as long as they follow some rules. It can expire but is typically VERY long term such as 20 years or \"until the author dies\". * **Trademarks** have to be registered and are very specifically limited to images, slogans, songs, and a few other types of art. These are typically used for branding and marketing. They MUST be renewed to remain valid, but there aren't limits to how often you can renew them. There are some weird processes where you can lose your right to claim a trademark, but they're pretty complicated. * **Patents** tend to cover inventions rather than artwork. They must be applied for, and the invention has to be pretty unique to get a patent. You MUST publish enough information to teach someone how it works to get a patent, because the intent is after the patent expires anybody is allowed to make it.  Sometimes someone might choose not to patent an invention and instead just try to keep it secret. For example, consider \"secret formulas\" like the recipe for Coca-Cola. If they had applied for a patent, they would have to publish the recipe and anyone could make an EXACT version of it by now. So instead, they kept it a secret. There are lots of copycat colas on the market now, and Coca-Cola can't sue people for that, but they CAN claim that nobody else has *exactly* the same recipe.",

But if you are looking at a screen from a significant distance, you will struggle to tell any difference in resolution between them. This is because the smallest object your eye can perceive does _not_ depend on the actual size of the object, but rather what proportion of your field of view that object makes up.   A [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity) referenced by Wikipedia gives the maximum *angular* resolution of the human eye (with no visual defects and good lighting) as 0.008 degrees. If we take this value to be accurate, and assume you are looking at a screen 1m away, this corresponds to a pixel size of approximately 0.14mm.   For a 27\" 16:9 monitor, this means that the maximum resolution you could make out (at a viewing distance of 1m) is around 4300x2400, which is a bit more than 4K. The larger the monitor and nearer it is to your screen, the higher the resolution you'll be able to distinguish.",

    "answer": "It's important to understand that voltage is relative. It's not an absolute measure of electric charge. It's a measure of electric potential, or the difference in charge between two different points in a circuit. \"Ground\" is identified as a universal reference point for your system. All voltages are measured relative to something, and that something is typically the ground. And the ground has zero electric charge.  In the case of your house it's actually the neutral wire that's carrying current back , which is a bit more complicated to understand. There's some good [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-W42tk-fWc) videos that walk through it.   The question you're asking in residential 120V AC systems however, there's typically no current flowing through the ground wire. The neutral wire carries current back to the source and the ground wire is just a 0V reference point and a safety.",

    "answer": "A few different things can happen to make you constipated, and usually you have all of these things happening together in varying degrees:  Your gut motility (how much the walls are moving stuff through) slows down  You absorb too much water from your intestines into your blood  Your faeces become compacted and hard  Anything you eat that causes any of this to happen is what causes constipation.   Basically, it\u2019s anything low in fibre, high in sugar, and lacking fermentation.  Fibre increases faecal bulking, which stops your stool from becoming compact and hard.   It also draws water into your colon through *osmotic pressure* and encourages gut motility.  Fibre also feeds the natural microflora in your gut, which promotes gut health and further prevents constipation.   If your food is low in fibre, you have none of these benefits, and you are at risk of constipation.  If you eat a diet that has very little fermented food (cheese, yoghurt, kombucha, beer) then you also may become constipated.   These foods contain bacteria that help your intestines function.   They promote gut motility by irritating your gut lining.   They also help digest some of the food you eat and spit out things you need but can\u2019t make by yourself - things like vitamins.   They help the fibre bulk up your poop and draw water into your intestines.",

    "answer": "Heres some more context, the surface level info just doesn't explain whats up and why this isn't as big an issue as it seems. There's a lot of stuff happening in public just for the sake of looking good.  Australia wanted attack subs to counter china. France, US, UK all have a big presence in the Pacific and wanted Aus to be more involved, and Aus did too.  The best subs are nuke subs. However, no one is willing to sell nuke subs, because no one likes exporting nuclear military tech. So Aus had only 1 option, to buy new, but completely obsolete diesel subs.  France won the deal to provide them subs. It was the biggest military deal in French history and a huge deal. But again... this was for obsolete subs.  Behind the scenes, the UK started pressuring the US to say \"hey, it would be super cool if you sold Aus nuke subs, we know you absolutely don't do that, but maybe you would here.\" The US--unexpectedly agreed, yup, we'll sell em nuke subs. This ended up being part of a larger defense agreement between US, UK, and Aus.  Aus was absolutely jumping up and down, these US nuke subs are epicly better than anything France would provide.  Aus canceled their order with France to take US nuke subs instead-- the obvious choice, its WAY better, no one is arguing that. Even France can't argue-- the US made nuke subs are so much better for what is happening its not even close.  Publicly-- France says they were blindsided by the deal! How dare our allies do this! Privately, it seems they were at least partly in the loop of what was happening, but can't admit they knew because it would look so bad that they lost the biggest deal in their history and they don't want to admit any of this stuff to their people that they were giving Aus shitty subs and got taken over simply by a better product.  Once the US-UK-Aus deal was announced France had to act out publicly purely to fake like they were mad to save face to their people and businesses, but they knew what was up. Its all a charade.",

The question of diesel vs nuclear is economic in nature, can I afford to operate a nuclear sub and am I willing to pay for those benefits?

    "question": "ELI5 how does the IRS \"wash rule\" work?",
    "answer": "Put simply, the wash sale rule prohibits an investor from claiming a capital loss for tax purposes if they repurchase the stock or security within 30 days.1  Specifically, the IRS deems a transaction a wash sale if the investor does the following 30 days before or after a sale:  1. Purchases the same investment 2. Purchases a substantially similar investment 3. Enters into a contract to buy a similar investment 4. Acquires a similar stock for an IRA or Roth IRA  An Example  Imagine an investor unfortunate enough to purchase Lucent Technology stock when it was trading upwards of $70 per share. Over subsequent years before the firm disappeared through mergers and acquisitions, that investor watched accounting scandals, financial trouble, and sales meltdowns wipe the share price down to $1.3  Ever the enterprising baron, our investor realizes that if they sell their shares, they can report a capital loss and lower their tax burden. The problem? They believe that Lucent, or the firm that ultimately owns it, will rise from the ashes and return some of the market value which it has lost.  Suddenly, our investor gets a brilliant idea. During the last week of December, they call their broker with instructions to sell their shares in the telecom equipment supplier, locking in the capital loss. Three weeks later, during the first half of January, they ask their broker to repurchase those shares of Lucent. All is well in the world; they locked in the capital loss while holding onto the shares. Seems ingenious, right?  The wash sale rule, as you remember, does not allow an investor to claim a capital loss if they repurchase the investment within 30 days. In other words, unless the investor waits until the 30-day period has elapsed, they will not be able to write the off the loss.  There are ways around this, but let us assume the guy in the article didn't do that.  He sells his shares down at $1 in December, buys them back in the next year at nearly the same price, and the stock goes back up.  His 2019 taxes say he lost $5,000,000 and he got an $800,000 tax break, but in 2020, they went up to a total of $5,045,000 ($45,000 profit), but he gets penalized for the wash sale, and has to pay back the $800,000",
    "follow-up": "So in this scenario, is this assuming that the $1 share climbs back to or above $70? What if the share only climbed to $30, would he still owe that what he lost?

We're trying really hard to get to that level of technology, but it still eludes us.  **edit because this seems to bother a lot of people**:  *We can't* **efficiently** *or* **at scale** *generate blood in a lab. While people are right that we've made many advancements in terms of being able to grow organs or even clone entire creatures, those are expensive, time-consuming, and very prone to failure. With our current technology, while it might be possible to produce something workable, it would be so little blood and cost so much it makes no sense to bother given that there are literally billions of eligible donors producing it for free.*  *If you trained really hard for the next 5 years, you could probably bulk up and win in a fight with a leopard.

    "question": "Eli5: why aren\u2019t busses designed to be more aerodynamic, like cars and SUVs?",
    "answer": "Air resistance (or *drag*) goes up quadratically with speed. That is, if you double your speed, the drag quadruples. At lower speeds, air resistance is less of a factor. Buses, at least on urban routes, don't go very fast, so they don't experience as much drag as a car might have to deal with.   In addition, drag strongly depends on your cross-sectional area. Now, buses have a much larger cross-sectional area than cars, so you might think that's bad for them. But their advantage is that they are very long. So, compared to their volume, and their capacity to move people, they actually have a rather small cross section.   You also have to consider why you want a (road) vehicle to be aerodynamic. Mainly this is to improve fuel economy. But fuel economy is really best thought of in terms of liters (or gallons) *per passenger* per kilometer (or per mile). Your car might get more miles per gallon than a bus, sure, but that bus is moving many more people for each mile that it travels. People who, if they were all driving cars, would burn a whole lot more fuel.   So in short, buses need to be designed to carry as many people as possible. That's where they achieve their gains compared to cars. Making the bus more aerodynamic isn't going to help very much with that, especially for buses that drive mostly on urban routes. In fact, your aerodynamic improvements might even make the bus' performance worse on the whole, if it means less room for passengers.",
    "follow-up": "This is really great analysis. I was thinking of it backwards - to save fuel, why not make them more aerodynamic? But I guess they don\u2019t have to save fuel!

A tour bus needs to have as big an interior as possible to hold all the people while staying within length and weight limits. A big aerodynamic nose ads length that can't be occupied by people. But you can see that modern tour buses try to be aerodynamic within that constraint, especially with front ends that slope towards the top and rounded edges.   Aerodynamics is in part a function of frontal cross section, so buses are already screwed by their very nature. Aerodynamic drag is also a function of length -- all else being equal, the longer object will generally have less drag. Buses are already long, so that helps.   The real killer for tour buses is actually having that big flat rear-end. That creates airflow separation with a huge amount of turbulence, and thus drag. They could make it much more aerodynamic with a Kammback, where the rear is tapered to 50% of the cross section before cutting off, but again, that problem of added useless length.",

Things like rigor mortis (the stiffening of the body's muscles) happen in under 15 hours; determining how close the body is to full rigor mortis can help them nail down a timeline.  Bodies decompose; examining how much the body has decomposed adds another datapoint. The eyes in particular have a series of changes they go through that can help a coroner determine time of death.  As for cause of death, the coroner can look at a few things. The stomach's contents can be tested to rule out poisoning. The type of impact wound can help determine what killed an individual. For example, finger marks around the neck could be consistent with strangulation. A bullet wound could explain cause of death as well. You could check for blood/water in the lungs, etc...

The most interesting example that comes to my mind, is how powder from gunshots create different patterns on the skin that can help tell if the person was alive when it was shot, the angle from the shot, and even the distance from the gun.

    "answer": "Back in the 2017 crypto bull run, bitcoin was really expensive to send around because of the network congestion but sending eth around was super cheap. Since eth allows you to do smart contracts, you can make an eth token called \u201cbitcoin\u201d (or \u201cwrapped bitcoin\u201d so it doesn\u2019t confuse people), and essentially lock up an actual bitcoin in a ethereum smart contract and send around that eth token (called eth wrapped bitcoin) instead.   The real bitcoin is still there, gaining or losing value, but you can send around your eth token and pay minimal eth fees instead of sending around that actual bitcoin.  Fast forward to this bull run and people made jokes how it should be bitocin wrapped eth now (since eth fees got pretty ridiculous). This can\u2019t happen quite yet because bitcoin can\u2019t do smart contracts.  It\u2019s basically a bridge between chains. So you can use any coin on any network.  Edit:  I\u2019m going to add to this because I\u2019m obsessed with crypto and want everyone else to be as well.   You may see tokens like cETH, aUSDC, or CAKE-LP (as opposed to the actual assets: ETH, USDC, or CAKE). These are called proof of ownership tokens. You can look at them like receipts.   For example, let\u2019s say I have some USDC (US dollar coin), and I want to get interest on my USDC. To do this, I deposit them into a lending pool (let\u2019s say I use the Aave protocol). Once they leave my wallet, I get aUSDC (Aave USDC) in return. This is an absolutely amazing and overlooked feature of crypto. This aUSDC I have is just as valuable as the asset itself + any interest it\u2019s generating. If I sent you my aUSDC tokens, you can withdraw all my usdc (and any accrued interest) out of Aave. This allows the usdc holder to not only gain interest in the Aave lending pool but now take that \u201creceipt\u201d and use that value somewhere else to generate even more passive income.   Uhhhg I could go on but then I\u2019ll for sure be treading on waters that are too difficult for 5 year olds if I haven\u2019t already >.<  Dm me if you have any questions!

    "follow-up": "Since you're a crypto enthusiast, could you explain the reasoning behind it? From an economics point of view crypto is at best a store of value (assuming it's relatively predictable).   I think my econ prof explained it best with the gold coins vs silver coins example. When there were gold coins and silver coins, people would hoard the gold, and spend the silver. This was because silver was relatively abundant and more was entering the supply each day. As a result of the influx, silver devalued while gold didn't. Applying this to crypto, we have fiat currency and crypto, even assuming that crypto tames volatility, it's still just another gold, except you can argue that gold has intrinsic value from being useful, whereas crypto is just a thing that exists.  I don't see what crypto is supposed to do, it's advertised strengths are, security of value, and freedom of capital.  However, store of value only works when there is relative stability, which there isn't. And even if there were, it still holds no advantages over gold. Additionally, transitioning to a crypto based currency system would mean national governments lose the ability to pursue expansionary fiscal (and monrtary) policy, resulting in every economic downturn hitting like it was 1929. The freedom of capital is also dubious since, the blockchain is made up mainly of large operations as opposed to the grassroots vision of people with their GPUs. If crypto were a mainstream commerce tool beyond a speculative thing, it would once again be dominated by institutional players like banks, and with a digital medium they can probably pull as yet unthought of schemes.",

    "question": "Eli5: How exactly do our brain cells capture and record memories? And then play them back in our heads with sound?",
    "answer": "We dont fully understand the way cells store and retrieve memories, but I can give an overview based off what we do know. Keep in mind the brain is incredibly complex and we have multiple structures interacting here.. Certain brain cells (groups of neurons and synapses) can be chained together to react to a specific stimuli delivered from the brain. Because of this, one system of the brain can \"tell\" a group of cells to react a specific way in the future. In the case of memory, the brain structure responsible for memory formation tells a group of brain cells to react a specific way to another stiumuli: the one triggered by the memory retrieval system.   So one system has the ability to tell brain cells how to form memories, and another knows how to send out an impulse to relieve that memory, and interpret it. But this in turn triggers a bunch of other systems: the ones responsible for how we perceive the world. Our brain is really good at simulating a world we can navigate based on stimuli. We really don't interact with the world, but a simulation our brain comes up with. So that same ability can be applied to generate something without any external stimuli, such as the memory retrieval system.  So the full loop ends up being outside stimuli are taken in, the world perception is formed, the memory formation system stores it in some brain cells, the memory retrieval system triggers a retrieval, and the world perception system can be leveraged to take that stimuli and make yourself perceive the sound of Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes or whatever.   I hope that made some semblance of sense.",

    "answer": "Electrons are bound to their atomic nuclei reasonably well, like a tetherball on a bungee cord, but that cord isn't infinitely strong  You can hit them with a bat(mid power photon) to give them some extra energy and stretch out the bungee cord, but the cord will pull them back in and they'll give off the extra energy as a twang(photon in this case)  Gamma rays take this to more of an extreme.  You're not pulling on the tether ball or hitting it with a bat to give it some more energy, you're putting it on the barrel of a battleship gun and shooting it point blank.  The gamma ray hits the electron and it has sooooo much energy that it overwhelms any pull to the atomic nuclei and it just goes flying off away from the nuclei  You can pull it off with wayyy lower energy levels too.  Ionizing radiation (generally UV-C through Xrays to Gamma rays) all have enough energy that when they hit an electron they can give it enough energy to break free from its nuclei and go flying off.  Most things below are just absorbed and then turned into kinetic energy (wobblier atoms) or given off as light (think things that glow under blacklights)",

    "answer": "Marine fishes have two options for osmoregulation(fancy word for making sure the animals body has the right salt:water ratio) : accumulate enough salts to make your inner organs have the same salt concentration as the outer water. This way getting fresh water doesnt matter since your body is adapted to the salt. Other option, is to have good kidneys that can get a lot of the salt out through piss more salty than the csgo community. This way the animal doesnt need to modify its entire body to work with salt water.  First option is used by marine sharks, rays, etc while the second is used by marine bony fishes. I didnt learn about marine mammals in particular, but I'd say its the second option. Correct me if im wrong.  PS: Yes OP, basically all mammals and most organisms do need fresh water.   EDIT: shoutout to u/mynameismrguyperson for the extra info that technically sharks dont accumulate the sea salts, rather they build up urea(main waste in urine) and a fancy chemical called TMAO that is sort of equivalent to accumulating sea salts.  EDIT: https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/204/11/1831/32941/Osmoregulation-in-Marine-Mammals  Turns out Im wrong and mammals are not at all similar to fishes in osmoregulation tactics.

From an economic standpoint, look at is as supply and demand or the concept that scarcity increases the value of goods.

Some linear algebra and statistics are going to make it much easier for you to understand what you're doing. Otherwise you just end up copying bits of code that make no sense to you.   That being said, matrices and the operations you can do on them are basically just convenient mathematical shorthand for working with sets of numbers that have a certain structure to them. For instance, in a matrix the rows often correspond to one variable, and the columns to another. For instance, each column might be a quantity that you measured, and then each row contains a set of simultaneous measurements of all these quantities. To make that even more concrete, each row might be a different house, and then the columns might be the square footage, distance to the nearest mall, and price of each house.   In other words, matrices are basically just tables, but without the headers that tell you what each row or column represents.  Transposing a matrix just means swapping the rows and columns. So in our example, you now would have square footage in row 1, distance to nearest mall in row 2, and price in row 3, and then each column is now a different house for which you recorded those three numbers.   Why do we transpose? That has to do with the operations you can do on matrices. Specifically,  matrix multiplication. Matrix multiplication is different from *scalar* multiplication (scalars are just single numbers, as opposed to vectors or matrices which contain multiple numbers). If you have two scalars *a* and *b*, then *ab* = *ba.* That is, the order of multiplication doesn't matter. But if you have two matrices, *A* and *B*, then in general, you don't have *AB = BA.* And in fact, you may not even be able to compute both of these products. That's because, for matrix multiplication, the dimensions of the matrices need to match up in a certain way. For instance, if *A* is a \\[10 x 3\\] matrix, that means it has 10 rows and 3 columns. Now let's say *B* is a \\[3 x 8\\] matrix. In that case, the matrix product *AB* will have size \\[10 x 8\\]. The sizes that went into the multiplication were \\[10 x 3\\]\\*\\[3 x 8\\]. Notice that the 3 matches up between the two matrices, and disappears from the resulting matrix. That's important. If these numbers didn't match up, then you couldn't multiply these matrices. For instance, if *A* were \\[10 x 5\\], for instance, then you simply wouldn't be able to multiply *A* by *B*.   But let's go back to the situation where *A* was \\[10 x 3\\]. We were able to compute the matrix product *AB* because the dimensions matched up. But if we swap the order to *BA*, now the dimensions that go into the product are \\[3 x 8\\]\\*\\[10 x 3\\]. Now the \"outer\" dimensions match up, but that's no good. It has to be the \"inner\" dimensions that are the same.   This is all just to illustrate that matrix products depend on having dimensions that match up in a certain way. Note that I haven't described how to actually calculate a matrix product, and I won't go into that. Again, I highly recommend that you take a (free, online) linear algebra course to learn all about that. All you need to remember for now is that there is this operation called a matrix product and it depends on getting the matrix dimensions to match up.  Now suppose that we have a matrix *C* that has size \\[3 x 7\\]. Can we multiply this with *B* (which is \\[3 x 8\\]? Not as it is. *CB* would be \\[3 x 7\\]\\*\\[3 x 8\\], and *BC* would be \\[3 x 8\\]\\*\\[3 \\* 7\\]. The inner dimensions don't match in either case. But what if we *transpose* *C*? Recall that this means swapping the rows and columns. We write the transposed version of *C* as *C**^(T)**.* When we transpose, the dimensions of the matrix are swapped, so *C**^(T)* has size \\[7 x 3\\]. Aha, but that means that we *can* calculate the product *C**^(T)**B*! Because then we're multiplying matrices of dimensions \\[7 x 3\\]\\*\\[3 x 8\\], so now the inner dimensions *do* match up, and the result is a new matrix of size \\[7 x 8\\].   So in short, there are operations that we can do on matrices, which depend on the arrangement of their rows and columns. Transposing a matrix changes this arrangement in a particular way, that is very often useful or necessary.",

    "answer": "It's all geometry. The sun radiates equally in all directions. So think about a position that is some radial distance from the sun (like earth at some single spot in its orbit). That distance, in 3D, forms an imaginary shell around the source, the sun, and all points perfectly equidistant the centre; a sphere. By analogy, in 2D, a ring. If we compare rings of different sizes, but with the same centre, we can ask how we get from one ring to the other. I mean, how do we get the smaller ring to grow to be the larger one? The \"most evenly fair\" way is if the ring grew evenly, I mean all parts expanding uniformly. Now take a \"thin pizza slice\" worth of an entire ring, like 5 degree's worth. For the smaller ring to grow to the bigger ring that same section \"stretches\" and if stretching evenly it makes sense to think that we could draw as many lines straight from one to the other. Those lines are straight and perfectly radial, that is, they go straight back to the centre if we imagine. So? Those individual lines don't have any \"angle\" to them. Each is straight from the centre. That's what we perceive. This applies because light is a wave phenomenon, and waves, like ripples a pound have this property.",

    "answer": "Hearing scientist here.  Yes and yes.  When we hear, its because the air in our ear is pushing and pulling on the eardrum.  If this pushing and pulling has a regular structure to it, we hear it as a particular pitch or mix of pitches.  This covers music, but also voices, bells, and a bunch of stuff.  If the push/pull is a very short, intense burst, it's more like a click or snap that we hear.  (More detail: this is really a wide range of different pitches stacked on top for a short amount of time.)  If the push/pull is chaotic, we hear noise like a woosh or a hiss.  When wind blows past your ears, it doesn't flow smoothly.  It's turbulent, constantly changing.  This means some of the bits of wind will push extra air into your ear, or try to suck air out.  This pushes and pulls on your eardrum in a chaotic way, and you hear it as noise.  When the wind makes more of an \"ooooh\" noise, that's just that its a bit more structured, usually flowing quickly in one direction, so we hear it as a particular pitch.  Actually, its often a burst of wind that's speeding up, so we hear the pitch rising.  But we *can* also hear the chaotic vibrations that get made as it flows through trees and things.  It's just that they're not any more distinct than the noise at our ears.  However, gaps between buildings etc. help make the air flow a particular way, which lends itself to the \"ooooh\" sound.

They can be unreliable if you are doing any heavy streaming. No matter how well you are connected to the extender you will only get half strength since that is what the extender is connected to. If you want good coverage on your wifi. The best thing to do is to run additional access points . That requires wire runs between the access point and your router switch. If you can't run wires then you should look into a mesh system. They are expensive but work a hell of lot better than extenders.  Extenders are connected to your wifi. Your device is connected to the extender, the extender has to decrypt your signal from your device, and encrypt it again to relay it to your wifi router.  Additional access points are wired to a router switch and operate independently or with management software.

    "answer": "I work in a lab in a hospital. The short answer is it's expensive to test for everything. And often not necessary either. The longer version is multifaceted and complex.  First off, blood is full of so many different things and the way to measure all those things is different too. Using an Ion Slective Electrode with different cells can tell you the electrolyte concentrations (although it's three different galvanic cells - one for Sodium, one for Potassium, one for Chloride). And there's different reagents for protein, albumin, enzymes like ALT or ALP, CK, troponin (a marker used to detect heart damage), and lots of others. When I do maintainance on the chemistry analyzer there's dozens of little bottles of reagents to manage. Because take the same sample, mix it with Bromcresol Green, shine a light through it and you can measure the amount of albumin in the sample. But it will only tell you that. You have to take another aliquot (science word for small sample) and mix it with other chemicals to tell you other things.  And there are different color blood tubes to tell you other things. Lavandet tubes have EDTA in them and are used in hematology but aren't really good for chemistry. EDTA pulls calcium out of the blood to arrest the clotting process so we don't really use EDTA tubes in chemistry since measurement of calcium is important. In hematology it's about measuring the amounts of the components of blood. Red cell count, white cell count, platelet count, hemoglobin content, the relative proportion of each type of blood cells (referred to as a differential).  Our formulary in the lab (kind of a guide to different tests) has so many hundreds of different kinds of tests that it would be a huge waste of resources to order everything on everyone. Someone comes in with chest pain to the ED. They will likely order a troponin level, along with some sort of metboloic panel (either a BMP, CMP, or a rental function panel which is really a BMP with a couple additional tests), along with a CBC, maybe a lactate too. Potentially a PT/INR or aPTT too. Basically the doctor looks at the symptoms and uses the blood tests as kind of a guide as to where to go next. Troponin came back negative? Probably not a heart attack. You wouldn't typically order a Hebatits B Surface Antigen test if the person had no reason (or symptoms) that match the diagnostic picture. If we wanted to run every test in the formulary on a patient we might bleed them dry drawing 100 different tubes. Not literally but it's like what's the point?  And as doctors get more information, say the symptoms evolve, or a test points in a specific direction, they add on tests all the time after the fact. But like if a person has no symptoms of diabetes, why bother ordering a Hemoglobin A1C if you know they aren't diabetic? Or at least aren't at any risk of having it.  Edit: also I don't think there's a lab out there that tests for everything. I work in a 'full service lab' in a community hospital that is part of a large hospital system in my area. Something like dozens of facilities, some 30,000 employees across the system. We don't do everything though. We don't have a microbiology laboratory in our lab so all our micro samples go downtown. Other more specialized tests also go downtown to the core lab. Ferritans, Vitamin B12s, procalcitonins, etc. But not everything goes to the core lab either. We have a variety of sendouts that go to other reference labs in the area. I think it's just not feasible to have enough equipment to test for everything everywhere.",

So the system admin would have to either fake transactions from real accounts (in which the owners would quickly find out) or try to fake a physical interaction (counterfeit money or a fraudulent check) in order to gain money for themselves.  It should be self-evident that, if you're making counterfeit money that can pass bank inspections, you're in a far different tier than hacking bank accounts.

You fire a particles at a target, each other together the sum to the atomic weight you want, and you hope that A) you manage to collide two nuclei, B) you overcome the weak force that repels nuclei, and C) the two nuclei fuse. Your next problem is even if you are successful, most of the remaining theoretical atoms are unstable, so they'll decay almost instantly. That's fine. We learn most of what we do from the decay products of these unstable atoms. The trick is you have to detect the decay. And you need enough of a sample size to be assured you've reliably detected the decay of your theoretical atom. The problem is sufficiently hard that we're not seeing too many new elements being created. All the low hanging fruit has been picked.

    "question": "eli5: What does it mean when people say that time works differently in space?",
    "answer": "The effect is very, very minor, but it *does* happen!  You're probably familiar with the name *Albert Einstein* from his famous equation E=mc^2.  If you're particularly geeky, \"Hey, Einstein, I'm on your side!\"  Something else he's known for is the theory of *relativity* (two of them, actually) which say that a lot of things are *relative to* other things -- that is, they can't be objectively measured. Specifically, we're interested in the components of both theories that talk about time.  The theory of *special relativity* says that a moving clock ticks slower than a stationary clock. That is, a clock that's moving very fast will measure time slower ***relative to*** a clock that's not moving. It won't see its own seconds passing any slower, but it will see a stationary clock's seconds passing *faster.*  The other theory, about *general* relativity, says that a clock deeper in a gravity well ticks slower than one farther away. Conversely, a clock further away ticks faster.  Put these two together, and someone living on a space station actually experiences the flow of time very slightly differently: after spending six months aboard the ISS, Einstein's theories predict that an astronaut would age about 0.005 seconds *less* than us schlubs on Earth.",
    "follow-up": "I would like to add a correction that a \u201cmoving\u201d clock will not see a \u201cstationary\u201d clock tick faster. The entire principal of relativity is founded on the idea that there is no absolute motionlessness.   When you move at a high speed in a car, train, or airplane, the only way you can tell you\u2019re moving is from the wiggling of the vehicle with bumps/turbulence, and seeing the land pass by through the window. If you were theoretically in a plane that experienced no turbulence, and had no windows, there would be *no experiment* you could perform that would tell you you\u2019re moving.   What this means is that person A can say they\u2019re standing still, and person B is moving, but person B can say that **they\u2019re** standing still, and A is moving. Both are correct, and both can apply the laws of physics as if they were standing still.   In the context of special relativity, this means that if B is moving relative to A, then A will see B\u2019s time slow down (B\u2019s clock will tick at a slower rate). However, from B\u2019s perspective, **they\u2019re** the one standing still, so they won\u2019t see A\u2019s time ticking faster. In fact, they\u2019ll see A\u2019s time ticking **slower**.   This might seem like a contradiction. If both A and B see each other\u2019s clocks ticking slower, then who\u2019s right? If you bring them back together again, then surely one of their clocks will be further behind, proving that their view was wrong, right? This is commonly known as the twins paradox (twin A stays on Earth, twin B shoots out to Jupiter and back on a rocket)  To resolve this apparent paradox, there are two other things we need to talk about.   First off, simultaneous events that are separated in space are not necessarily simultaneous in other reference frames. For twin A, a clock starts simultaneously on Earth and Jupiter. When twin B reaches Jupiter, the Jupiter clock is ahead of B\u2019s since B\u2019s clock was running slow.    From B\u2019s perspective though, the two previously simultaneous events of Earth\u2019s and Jupiter\u2019s clocks starting at the same time are no longer simultaneous. Jupiter\u2019s clock actually starts *before* Earth\u2019s and even with the slowing down from Jupiter\u2019s relative motion, this means that when B gets to Jupiter, that planet\u2019s clock is still ahead of B\u2019s.   That way, both A and B agree on the results: Jupiter\u2019s clock is ahead of B\u2019s. They just disagree on why.   The second phenomenon is the fact that time in locations you accelerate towards speeds up, and time in locations you accelerate away from slows down (or even reverses)   In the case of the twins paradox, this is helpful because for twin B to get back to Earth, they need to accelerate back towards it. That acceleration causes Earth\u2019s clock to speed waaaaay up (from B\u2019s point of view), making up for its slowness. This means that when B gets back to Earth, they expect the Earth clock to be ahead of their own.   Twin A didn\u2019t undergo any acceleration though, so just like before, they think that B\u2019s clock should just be running slow, since it\u2019s moving, and therefore that Earth\u2019s clock should be ahead of B\u2019s.   Once again, they both agree on the results, even if the effects are different.   So yeah, anyway, that\u2019s all to say that \u201cmoving\u201d people won\u2019t see \u201cstationary\u201d people\u2019s clocks speed up. Everyone sees everyone else\u2019s clocks slow down.",

First, there are different kinds of motors. \"Brushed\" motors are cheaper, but the way they're put together makes them louder and more likely to break. \"Brushless\" motors are more expensive, quieter, and easier to maintain. But some high-quality appliances use brushless motors and are still loud. Why?  Size and cost are big reasons.   Appliance motors have to be very small and fit in small spaces. They generate a lot of heat and need to pull in air to cool themselves. There's not a lot of room for sound dampening or vibration isolation, and it would make the appliances cost more. Further, a lot of the premium devices are sold based on how much power they have, and people think a louder motor has more power. (They've never thought about how a lawnmower is often louder than a car!) So not a lot of people are really shopping for a *quiet* blender or vacuum, especially if it means they become so large they aren't easy to use or so expensive they aren't worth it.   Car motors, on the other hand, are part of a very expensive purchase. People expect them to be quiet, it's one of their selling points. The engineers have a lot of room, so ventilation is a lot easier to do and they have the budget to deal with vibration and sound dampening.",

    "answer": "Inflation is a \"market\" thing.  Prices aren't (usually) set by some entity. For something like an electronic component, the company that makes it decides what to sell it for. Companies that make things like TVs decide what to sell the TVs for. They want that price to be higher than the cost of the stuff they bought to make it. They also pay attention to what their competitors are charging and want their price to be below their competitors', unless they think they have a better offering.   If the company wants to make more money, or if they think the costs of making the TV are going to go up, they raise their price. If it's true the costs of their materials went up, it's likely their competitors' prices are going up too. If their competitors see their prices go up even when materials aren't going up, their competitors might raise their prices to match. Or, if the store that sells the TVs wants more money, they might raise the price they sell the TVs for so they make a little more profit.   The only way to truly stop inflation is for the government to set the price for *everything*, but that creates a lot of other economic problems. Instead, we prefer for the government to take indirect actions like changing the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the government. That changes how banks issue loans, which changes how people invest, which can tighten or loosen a lot of purse strings that ripple through the economy.",
    "follow-up": "This doesn't make sense.   All companies always want to make more money. If they raised price because their material vendor raised price, why was material vendor able to raise price when they weren't before?   Why didn't the customer simply decide not to buy or buy a complimentary good or why didn't a competitor undercut them to take their market share? The things that happen when a company sets a price too high for the market.   The reason they were able to raise price is because inflation isn't a \"market\" thing. It's a currency thing and the state controls the currency in almost all cases.

    "answer": "There is an interesting explanation for this. Yes light can only move at the speed of light. However empty space can expand faster than light. Space is kinda strange like that. But this is what all the models show. Empty space can expand faster than light.",
    "follow-up": ">However empty space can expand faster than light.  This may be oversimplified to such a degree that it could lead people to the wrong idea.  Space expands at a rate of roughly 68km/s per megaparsec. In other words, if you had two objects a megaparsec (about 3.26 million lightyears) apart that were otherwise at rest relative to each other, the expansion of space alone would cause them to separate by about 68 kilometers per second. Which is a far cry shy of the 300,000 km/s that light travels.  However, it's cumulative. So if our objects are 2 megaparsecs apart, then space between them is expanding at about 136 km/s. 10 megaparsecs apart? About 680 km/s.  So once we get out to a little over 4,400 megaparsecs (~14.4 billion lightyears), those two objects are separating at about the speed of light due to the expansion of space at *all* points between them. It'd that last bit - all the space in between is expanding - that's really the key.   Meanwhile, due to said expansion, the very farthest objects in the Observable Universe are about 14,260 megaparsecs (46.5 billion lightyears) away from us. That means that because of the sheer distance, space is expanding at roughly 3.2 times the speed of light between Earth and an object on the edge of the Observable Universe.  As a final note, this expansion is extremely weak: 68km/s over a million parsecs is absolutely negligible on small scales like galaxies. For the Milky Way is somewhere around 0.03 megaparsec across, so gravity massively overcomes any expansion of space. Andromeda is about 2/3rds of a megaparsec away, so it's moving towards us much faster than space between us is expanding.",

    "question": "eli5 If an item is on allocation, but they ramp production, how does availability decrease?",
    "answer": "In the most general terms, a product goes into allocation when supply is unable to meet demand. The two basic reasons for this are a) supply has been disrupted and is lower than usual, or b) demand is higher than anticipated.   It might not be that the manufacturer is producing at the same rate, especially after the pandemic. Raw material supply might be disrupted, factories may have been run slower than normal, producers may not have anticipated more demand etc etc. Most factories cannot simply increase output - it could take weeks or months.",

    "answer": "[This is answered here very succinctly](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/7437/why-is-glass-transparent), but to summarise:    The two main factors of how a material interacts with light are its elemental composition and the arrangements of said elements (the atomic structure).  Elements have specific frequencies they absorb,  and when bonding to other elements and forming large structures these specific frequencies become whole frequency ranges.  Common glass is made of silicon dioxide and has an amorphous structure (no long range atomic structure), and it just so happens that across the visible range of wavelengths (~ 400 - 700 nvm) it doesn\u2019t absorb light.    It does absorb UV for example. Search google for something like \u201cglass transmission spectrum\u201d.",
    "follow-up": "The [question]( **\"Why is glass transparent?\"** has got an accepted [answer]( by [kakaz]( with the score of 73:  >Photons pass through glass because they are not absorbed. And they are not absorbed because there is nothing which &quot;absorbs&quot; light in visual frequencies in glass. You may have heard that ultraviolet photons are absorbed by glass, so glass is not transparent for them. Exactly the same happens with X-rays for which our body is nearly transparent whilst a metal plate absorbs it. This is experimental evidence.\r >\r >Any photon has certain frequency - which for visible light is related to the colour of light, whilst for lower or upper frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum it is simply a measure of the energy transported by photon. A material&#39;s absorption spectrum (which frequencies are absorbed and how much so) depends on the structure of the material at atomic scale. Absorption may be from atoms which absorb photons (remember - electrons go to upper energetic states by absorbing photons), from molecules, or from lattices.\r >There are important differences in these absorption possibilities:\r >\r > 1. Atoms absorb well-defined discrete frequencies. Usually single atoms absorb only a few frequencies - it depends on the energetic spectrum of its electrons. Regarding atomic absorption, the graph of absorption (plotted as a function of frequency of light) contains well-defined peaks for frequencies when absorption occurs, and no absorption at all between them.\r > 2. Molecules absorb discrete frequencies but there are many more absorption lines because even a simple molecule has many more energetic levels than any atom. So molecules absorb much more light.\r > 3. Crystalline lattices may absorb not only discrete frequencies but also continuous bands of frequencies, mainly because of discrepancies in the crystalline structure.\r >\r >As glass is a non-crystalline, overcooled fluid, consisting of molecules, its absorption occurs in the 1st and 2nd ways, but because of the matter it is composed of, it absorbs outside our visible spectrum.  ^(This action was performed automagically.)

Photons do NOT travel in straight lines. Photons propagate (spread) outwards as an expanding sphere at the speed of light. Once observed however, the sphere (more specifically, the wave function) collapses as you have determined a fixed point in which the photon exists at that given moment. At this point the photon no longer behaves as a wave. So the frequency is measuring exactly what it should be, the frequency of the wave pattern the photons make while expanding.

    "follow-up": "You mean burning gaseous hydrogen has a fuel in combustion engine?  Problem with that is many fold  First fuel storage.  Storing gaseous hydrogen vs liquid gasoline/diesel is more difficult. Storing liquid is easy.  Just have a thin wall jug and put a bit of metal around it for debris and crash protection.  Storing a gas, notably a high pressure compressed gas, means you need a thick wall pressure container with high pressure sealing ports (fuel filler) rather a liquid tank opening with a simple cap and rubber ring.    Compressed hydrogen gas is especially difficult because hydrogen molecule is the smallest molecule that exists, only 2 atoms.   This means hydrogen will leak out of and thru materials that will hold many other gaseous compounds.    The port seals for a hydrogen container are also equally problematic.    Unlike a liquid tank, when punctured, will leak liquid fuel and create a possibility of fire but the fuel still has to vaporize before catching fire. Liquid diesel fuel basically won't vaporize in normal conditions by itself.  However, When a high pressure gas tank is punctured, the escaping gaseous hydrogen is already vaporized and much more readily combustible.   And you most likely already know the much more energetic combustion of hydrogen vs things like gasoline or alcohol  The actual in-engine combustion.  Because hydrogen is a much more energetic combustion.  The flame front is much faster than a gasoline diesel combustion.  This means the components of your cylinder have to be stronger to withstand a shock rather than a punch.

    "question": "ELI5: Why is the gaming community trying to stop people from pre-ordering?",
    "answer": "Back in the day, a video game came on physical media and shops would have a limited stock on the day it was released. To ensure you could play it on day 1, you would \"pre-order\" your copy of the game to reserve it at the shop and go collect it on the day.   Knowing how many pre-orders there were helped game companies gauge the sort of popularity the game would have. Lots of useful information for them, and money in the bank.   The downside for consumers was that reviews for the game would come out after people had bought the game, so if it wasn't all that good, it was too late for those buyers unless they went through the hassle of refunding it.    These days, there is no physical disc. Games are bought and installed off of the internet. Steam or PSN or Xbox live have unlimited copies to sell the moment the clock hits 00:00. There is no benefit for the consumer to pre-order. They can buy whenever. There is only the aforementioned downside.   In the end, pre-ordering now means video game companies can make money of bad games, which is bad for gamers (no point making good games)",
    "follow-up": "It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s bad for the gamers who preordered - but if a company gets enough preorders, they have less incentive to actually put effort into the game. If you\u2019ve already made a huge profit before the game is even completed, why finish it? Why fix the bugs? Pre ordering can actually lead to a worse final product.",

    "answer": "What websites you're browsing: yes, but with some limitations; for example, they can only see what domain you're on - if you're on [https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), they can only see that you connected to [youtube.com](https://youtube.com).  They cannot see what's on your screen, unless they put a special tracking app on your phone.  They cannot see which apps you are using, unless - again - they put a special tracking app on your phone.  Apps access the internet in a similar way to browsers. So, if you log in to your bank app, they can only see that you connected to [https://myawesomebank.com](https://myawesomebank.com).  # Explanations  When you tell your browser to show [https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), it first needs to know what server hosts [youtube.com](https://youtube.com). So, it asks a special DNS server \"hey, what's [youtube.com](https://youtube.com)?\" And it'll respond \"It's 172.217.13.238!\" (I assume you know what an IP address is, but if not, it's basically like a home address - where a website lives in the internet.)  This is quite an old process, and in most circumstances is still done without any encryption - which basically means the employer can take a peek at it.  All other messages are sent encrypted (with HTTPS). This is that padlock icon in your browser, and it means that before sending anything, the browser and the server agreed to use a secret code so that noone else can read these messages.  However, some browsers (like Firefox (by the way you should totally switch to it it's really good)) can use DNS-over-HTTPS, which is the same encrypted connection to the DNS server. It's not the same level of security as using a VPN though, as they can still see that you're connecting to [172.217.13.238](https://172.217.13.238) and then do a reverse DNS lookup - that tells them you connected to some Google server, which could be anything. But for some websites that will reveal the domain name.  (A VPN would simply hide all of the domain names instead of just the bigger websites. That's most of the security benefits of having a VPN)",

This is just totally incorrect.   The 7 years war (1756\u20131763) was all about the balance of power between Brittan and France and spilled over into the balance of power in central Europe resulting in the emergence of Prussia at the expense of Austria and Sweden.  The war of the Spanish succession (1701-1714) Was about the HRE being too powerful and every one ganging up to strip Spain off from it.   The 30 years (1618 to 1648) was all about the balance of power between the big players of Europe. Namely the HRE and France.  The 100 years (1337\u20131453) drew in Scotland, Aragon, Castile and Bohemia, on the French side to stop England from conquering France.  There are a huge number of wars (650c-1000c) between the Eastern roman empire and like every eastern European state known to man over how far roman influence would be.

    "answer": "Because it takes time for the team to work on each version, despite cross play the PS and Xbox and PC versions all have different code that need to be updated specific to that console and it's easier to do it on certain platforms than others and instead of making consumers artificially wait to release it all at the same time they release it when it's ready and move on to finishing up the next one. After game released the budgets and teams taking care of it is dropped so it could be a small team working on the update while the rest of the team is working on the next game.

If the materials are grippy enough that the force applied (N) multiplied by \u0173 is greater than the objects weight (W) then it will be easier to push against the wall than to hold it up.  Mathematically it looks like this: F = N*\u0173 If W < F it will be easier If W > F you're better off holding the object.  Common values for \u0173 are 0.2-0.5.  Note that the friction coefficient decreases if the object starts moving, because dynamic friction isn't as strong as static friction. This is exactly why it's not as safe to screech to a stop when driving.",

Industrial salt aka road de-icing salt is very good at its main job of melting water or making brine ( used for things like oil drilling), but poisonous to eat even in small amounts.   Ice cream salt is salt for kitchen use to make ice cream, but is not food grade to eat because it could contain sand sized impurities.  Use it to make homemade ice cream, that's all it's good for.  Curing / Pickling salts are more \"food grade,\" and can be used for curing and pickling, but sometimes they include less safe Sodium Nitrite and Sodium Nitrate.  Those are not quite edible or palatable directly, but they make it possible for deli meats and bacon to exist.  Then you have your food grade salts which are virtually all Sodium Chloride, and wildly diverse by grain size and source, everything from table and kosher salts to Fleur le Sel to Himalayan.  MSG also deserves an honorable mention I think, as it is probably the most popular \"salt substitute\" seasoning out there.

At the base of the tree you have a single root, which then has multiple branches, and those branches have branches, and so on, until you get to the leaves.  [www.google.com](https://www.google.com) for example, is a leaf on this tree. Specifically the \"www\" is a leaf on the \"google\" branch which is a branch on the \"com\" root.  Now, the whole point of all of this is for your computer to be able to take a URL like \"[www.google.com](https://www.google.com)\" and convert it into an IP address because it is the actual IP address that computers need to talk. But, as we said, we can't just have a big ol' directory. There is just too much stuff and it's too dynamic.  Instead, we exploit the hierarchical nature of the tree. We go to the \".com\" tree and ask it, \"Who is responsible for holding all of the information of the 'google' branch?\" And it tells us. Then we go to that place and ask it \"Ok, who is responsible for holding all of the information of the 'www' leaf?\" And it tells us, and we go to that place and ask it \"Ok, give me the IP information for '[www.google.com](https://www.google.com)'\" And it tells you, and then your computer can communicate with it.

Why would they wait longer to take it back (unless they don't have enough $ to pay back the premium of course)?",
    "answer": "The difference is who gets to buy/sell the stock. For Redeemable Preferred Stock, the company can buy the stock back after a preset date at a preset price. For Retractable, the owner of the stock can choose to sell it back to the company after a preset date at a preset price.  The company could choose to wait until the stock is trading at a super high price. This way, they're getting it for a LOT below asking price. If the redeemable price is close to the market value, it would make more sense for the company to purchase the stock at the market value.  It's a lot closer to debt than a normal stock. While the owner of the stock is entitled to a piece of equity, the fact that it could be redeemed at any time is more characteristic of a loan.",

But I don't get the point of waiting longer since you will have to continually pay dividends on it right? And why would the company allow the investor to choose when to cash it in? Is the return on the premium smaller and interest smaller as a result?  &#x200B;  Edit: I forgot to mention this but it says the retractable preferred shares give the buyer the option to sell it back at maturity but that the company can also force it to do so... how exactly is this different from redeemable preferred stock???",

    "question": "ELI5 - my parents have a rain gauge outside that tells us how many inches of rain we got. Its a long glass cylinder that just catches the rain water. If it was skinnier, wouldn\u2019t it show we got more rain and if it was wider wouldnt it show we got less rain?",
    "answer": "If the same amount of rainwater went into two gauges, the skinnier one would fill up quicker because it has a smaller volume.  The trick is that the skinnier gauge will actually *collect* less water because the area the rain can fall into (i.e. the top of the cylinder) is also smaller.  Now, if you had a funnel and connected that to two different diameter cylinders, then the rain is falling into a fixed area - the top of the funnel.  *Then* they'd fill at different speeds.  But if the cylinder is just open, then it doesn't matter what diameter it is.  A wider one will require a greater volume of rain to fill, but it will collect that rain at a quicker rate because it has a wider opening.  This means they fill to the same height in the same amount of time.",

    "answer": "It's allowed because it's part of a contract that you sign when you purchase the property. An HOA can't just \"materialize\" and take control of your property.  Typically a developer/builder would create a small community of homes, when you bought a property from them you would have to sign a contract agreeing to their terms. For example that you wouldn't paint the house neon orange or start collected rusted out trash cars on your lawn. Remember, they still have other properties to sell and they don't want you to trash your house and prevent them from getting a good deal selling the other homes. Eventually the builder will sell all the properties and the contract you signed gets handed off into a HOA made up of the owners of the various properties.  Eventually, anyone you sell your home to will have to sign the same contract as part of the purchase of the home. So it's legal because you willingly and freely signed a contract with mutual benefits. If the members of the HOA decide it's BS and they don't want it anymore, the HOA can be dissolved by voting and legal means.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why was the discovery of zero (or the lack of a concept of zero) by ancient civilizations such a big deal?",
    "answer": "The basic idea of having zero of something being different from not having it is an important concept for mathematics.  Suppose I am a fruit seller, and I sell apples, oranges and pears, but not peaches.  Late in the afternoon, I have sold all of my apples, but still have a few oranges and pears left.  A guy comes up to me and asks me what I sell.  I tell him I have oranges and pears.  The guy tells me he wants to buy apples and peaches.  I explain to him that although I have neither apples nor peaches right now, I do sell apples, and if he comes back tomorrow I will have some apples for sale, but I never sell peaches.  I decide rather than having to explain this to every customer I will have a sign that tells people what I have available to buy, so the next day I have a blackboard in front of my stall and write apples: 15, oranges: 23, pears: 17.  As the day goes on, and I sell my fruit, I change the numbers so that as I sell the fruit, people passing by know what I have left to buy.  At some point I sell my last apple.  I want to be able to indicate that although I don't have any apples right now, I do sell them, and if they come back tomorrow I will have some more, but I want to make that distinct from the fact that I do not sell peaches.  If I can write apples: 0, oranges: 5, pears: 3, it says something different from saying oranges: 5, pears: 3, because it indicates that although I have no apples right now, I still do sell apples.  That might be a somewhat trivial example, but the ability to indicate that I have zero of something as distinct from not having it allows for a useful distinction to be made.  In more complicated mathematics, this becomes very important.",
    "follow-up": "Just to extend on why this is valuable as a mathematical tool, consider the concept of algebra.  In algebra, we use a letter to represent a number of something that has a value that can change over time.  Suppose I take two friends of mine, Alex and Ben, to the market.  Alex is an old fashioned guy and does not recognise 0 as a legitimate number.  Ben is all with this new-fangled arabic numerals stuff and is happy with the idea that 0 is a number.  We go to the fruit stall in the morning, and I ask each of them how they work out how many fruits the seller has on sale.  Alex says, \"that's easy. I count the number of apples, then the number of oranges and finally the number of pears, and add them together.\"  Ben says, \"yup, totally agree, that's th right way to do it.\"  In the afternoon, we go back to the stall, and I ask Alex how to calculate the number of fruits.  He says, \"no problem. I add the number of oranges to the number of pears.\"  Ben replies, \"what about the apples? this morning you had to add the number of apples too.  Now you're using a different method.\"  Alex says, \"well there aren't any apples, so I can't count them. I therefore have to use a different method.\"  Ben then explains, \"no, you can use exactly the same method as you did this morning.  You see because I can count the number of apples and find there are zero apples, I can once more count the number each of apples, oranges and pears, and then add them together.\"  The point here is Ben has realised that by having zero as a number, he can construct a systematic method of counting all fo the fruit that will always be true, both in the morning and in the afternoon.  Alex, without being able to see that zero apples is still a number of apples, has to use a different method in the morning and in the afternoon.  This idea of being able to create a formula for counting things or calculating things, where the same formula applies, regardless of what the numbers of the things is, is the basis of algebra.  Without zero as a legitimate number, Alex is unable to work with algebra, while Ben, with the number zero, is.  This is why a lot of important mathematical advances were made by arabic scholars, and why arabic words are used for things like algebra and algorithm, because they adopted zero as a number at a time when mathematicians in other parts of the world did not have zero, so could not make these advances.",

Yes, it can be more efficient to have the laser engraver begin at one corner of the sheet and work its way over to the other corner. Sometimes the drawing file (we make ours up in Corel Draw) can be optimized to encourage this. Sometimes, no matter what order you put the elements into the file, the laser engraver will etch one part of the sheet sooner than the part of the sheet you intended. Getting the file to \u201cdraw\u201d as quickly as possible involves some trial and error.  We also divide our drawings into three different color layers, which will be processed in this order: red, green, blue.  Red: anything that needs to be *rastered* will be in the red layer. The \u201cprint head\u201d of the laser engraver will zip back-and-forth rapidly firing the laser beam intermittently at low power to draw a bit of artwork, such as a company logo, on the plastic. The effect is like watching a black-and-white television picture being built up line-by-line.  Green: any thing that needs to be *vectored* is in this layer. Straight and curved lines are best drawn by keeping the laser beam on, but at low power, for the duration of each line being drawn. The \u201cprint head\u201d of the engraver will proceed in a smooth motion, along both the X and Y axes as needed to engrave each line.  Blue: all lines to be cut entirely through the acrylic sheet are in the blue layer. Moving the \u201cprint head\u201d around works just as it does in the green layer: smooth motions in both the X and Y axes as needed. But this time, the laser is firing a continuous beam for each cut that is at or nearly at full power. An air assist (either compressed air supplied by the building\u2019s compressor, or the laser engraver\u2019s built-in compressor) will be blowing continually to discourage a fire. Acrylic doesn\u2019t burn well, particularly if a constant stream of air is blowing out what flames do occur.",

    "answer": "Note that ice expands compared to liquid water, but once it's all solid, if you cool down the ice more and more it will contract.  The reason for ice having more volume than liquid water is that the molecules of liquid water are close to each other (like grains of sand), but to form ice they rearrange into a [hexagonal pattern](https://www.quora.com/If-cold-contracts-and-heat-expands-why-does-ice-expand) with a huge gap in the middle.  So density of a liquid vs. its solid form depends on the pattern that the atoms form when they go into their solid \"arrangement\".  Most materials [pack their atoms](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/0b/03/68/0b0368f4d6e909a6c0d31c4bfb07c7cc--electron-microscope-transmission.jpg) tightly, though some can form [more spaced out patterns](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fa5e60ba2e4cf382b201346d80cf5b77).",

    "answer": "No, they're not the same: When asleep your brain and body are extremely busy. In 90-minute sets your brain moves through various states as it sorts out memories from the day, changes hormone levels in your body, and does myriad other forms of upkeep. For example while asleep you heal 3-4x faster than awake.   In terms of the lived experience, the main difference is continuity.  When you're asleep, you still have various biological (and external) rhythms by which you \"know\" that time is passing.  When you lose consciousness, you cease. From your point of view no time has passed between losing consciousness and coming to. Whether for 10 minutes or 10 days you've skipped into the future in a blink, during which your brain has been doing very little of that upkeep.  So basically, you'd skip the night.  It is also worth noting that *there is no safe way to be hit unconscious*. Every time someone is knocked out, be it for a few seconds or a few hours, *there is always brain damage*. Maybe minor, but it's there. Think about the state of retired American football players, and those guys aren't even being hit hard enough to lose consciousness most of the time.",

    "answer": "Food intolerance (like lactose) is not an allergy. Most adult humans lose ability to produce an enzyme needed to digest lactose as they mature; some populations are more likely to keep it than others. Because you can\u2019t properly digest lactose, it ends up as sugar in your lower intestine, where certain bacteria use it as abundant food, growing more than they would normally and upsetting the balance with the rest of the flora that eventually results in gas/cramping/diarrhoea etc as your intestines try to get rid of the irritant.   Allergies are a consequence of your immune system encountering substances (often proteins, though not exclusively), that it identifies as harmful. It\u2019s a normal part of the immune system\u2019s function to detect and react to foreign substances - that\u2019s how it fights off infections by bacteria, viruses and parasites. But sometimes, it overreacts to things it shouldn\u2019t, like food, drugs, pollen etc - these are not harmful on their own, but the immune system responds as if they are and the mechanisms that would stop it from overreacting might be slow or weak. So you get allergic reactions. Obviously, not everyone is allergic to the same thing - I can eat as many peanuts as I want, but if I touch some insecticides, I get hives and eventually end up suffocating; you might react the same to strawberries. There\u2019s really no one cause that will determine when and if a reaction will happen.",

    "question": "ELI5 : You know that *clic* when your tank is full at the gas station, how does that work ?",
    "answer": "My job is actually training people on how gas station equipment works!   Basically, when you dispense fuel, vapors are created by the fuel splashing down into your tank. The vapor can cause explosions and health problems. You would be surprised at how much vapor pours out if the vapor recovery is malfunctioning. It's hard to see, but quite dangerous. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM\\_fFApTciI)   The entire time you are fueling, the small holes towards the tip of the nozzle are sucking the vapors back into the dispenser. The moment the nozzle clicks off, the fuel has blocked those vapor recovery holes and triggered the dispenser to stop. Your tank is pretty much full and the vapor recovery will no longer properly work. So that last pump of fuel you're putting in is causing an explosion risk and putting you at higher risk for cancers and such, and polluting the air more than you realize. Not really worth it for an extra 50 cents of gas.  EDIT: as somebody correctly  points out, vapor recovery is not always required for auto shut off nozzles, because diesel has auto shut off as well. There is a separate hole next to the vapor recovery holes that trips the shut off. This prevents fuel from being sucked up the vapor holes. So it is using air flow, and installed directly next to vapor recovery, but not necessarily truly connected.",

    "answer": "The answer actually depends on what programming language you're using.  In compiled languages like Java and C/C++, the code gets transformed into a computer runnable executable after you write it, which consists of binary instructions. This transformation is a process called \"compilation\".  By far the biggest non compiled language in use today is Python. In python, the code actually gets turned into binary on the fly as you run it.  Quick edit for clarification: A compiler can mean multiple things. If someone is talking about a Java compiler, they are generally referring to the entire pipeline that converts Java into machine code. However, if someone is talking about the compiler stage, they are probably referring to the individual part of compilation called \"the compiler\", which actually is not the part that creates binary.",
    "follow-up": "Java is actually a particularly interesting example because it's a bit of a hybrid.  Java is not directly compiled into a form of binary that the computer understands.  Rather, when the code is compiled, it's turned into what's called \"Java bytecode\", a form of pseudo-machine-language.  To actually run Java bytecode, you need an interpreter that can translate the bytecode into actual machine code your computer understands.  That's what's known as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  Any time you need to \"update Java\" to run something, that's what you're updating.  It's called a Virtual Machine because it works similarly to how actual machines process binary, but instead of being implemented in circuitry, it's all software.  Why go through all this trouble, you might ask?  Compatibility!  With traditional executable, you have to compile a different binary file for every kind of computer out there.  That's why you can't, say, install a Windows program on a computer running Linux (at least, not without running a Windows compatibility layer like WINE).  The operating systems don't speak the same kind of binary, so the code just doesn't work.  With a Java executable, it's the same language everywhere, since all the translation magic is handled by the different JVMs.  You can compile a jar file on any computer and transfer it to any other computer with a JVM installed and it'll run just fine.  Of course, there is a downside, too -- the act of running code through translation is necessarily slower than just having the computer run it itself.  As a result, Java code tends to run slower than equivalent code written in, say, C++.  Even still, there's a lot of work put into optimizing the JVM, so the difference isn't usually noticeable unless you're working on *serious* number crunching.",

It promises to let depositors withdraw their money when they please, but holds only part of its deposits in reserve in case they actually do. So effectively, by promising people access to more money than it actually holds in cash, a bank can introduce new money into the economy. This increase in liquidity encourages investment and economic growth. The system works so long as not too many people demand their money back at once (a \"run on the bank\").  This is like a Ponzi scheme in that there is a risk your deposit is not covered by cash actually held by the fund, but there's no element of fraud; the bank doesn't lie to you about where the interest it pays comes from or pretend to invest in assets in your name that don't actually exist. And the money it does make comes from real loans.  Governments control the risks of inflation from too much money from bank lending by making laws about how much the bank is required to hold in reserve, and by taking action with a central bank that then influences the lending behavior of other banks. They also create programs to insure deposits up to a certain amount, which eliminates the risk for depositors and thus the need to withdraw their savings if they are unsure about the bank, which also reduces risk for the bank.",

It's a finite amount of oxygen contained withing the compressed cork itself, thats why they seal the bottle with wax or a metal wrapper outside the cork. You want a little O2 for the nice slow oxidation of compounds in there to age properly, but once it's sealed the outside air isn't getting in.   Letting it breathe when it's open aims for a different reaction with other compounds, and its much more dramatic. But let it go on too long and the wine will be real nasty. So both aging and breathing aim for oxidation reactions, but different compounds at different rates for different goals.",

    "answer": "My GF was the consultant in charge of the project to explain to parents in CA why the change to Common Core was happening, help them understand the how and why behind what was being done, and to give them the tools to help their children with it.  Common Core was designed with a goal: to significantly increase the number of students graduating high school with the higher math knowledge such as basic Calculus, Trigonometry, etc.  that previously only a small percentage of the students managed during their high school education.  In the process of figuring out how to do this it became apparent that a lot of the traditional way that math concepts were presented and taught starting in Kindergarten and continuing in the primary school years were at best not optimal, and at worst actually counter-productive once students had to make transitions beyond arithmetic. This resulted in the creation of a unified curriculum of study that planned the whole set of goals, grade by grade, and how it was presented with this goal in mind.  They way that initial arithmetic is taught in Kindergarten is done with the goal of making sure that the math is taught not just to get whatever concept is currently being taught into their brains, but to always be focused on what they are going to have to learn down the road and lay the foundation for that.  One thing that stuck in my head while talking to my GF about it was that she noted how it become apparent how important it was to get the parents to understand that Common Core needed to be viewed as a 13 year process starting in Kindergarten and coming to fruition when their child graduated the 12th grade.  The standards were introduced in CA in 2014-15 school year, this means that the first class of students who will graduate having been taught by this method for their entire public school education will be the class of 2028.

    "question": "ELI5 how do water wells work? Why did medieval people know where to build them or why they provided clean drinking water?",
    "answer": "Have you ever sat by a lake or river and dug a little hole in the ground? After a while, water will collect in the bottom, because the water flows through dirt and stone around the river too. When it rains, a lot of water flows down into the ground and that ground that carries water is called an aquifer. Depending on what kind of dirt and rocks are there and how the hills and mountains are sloped, it will collect in certain places.   Very ancient people needed water to live, just like we do today. They usually chose to live near rivers, lakes, and streams. They also dug little holes in the ground nearby, and noticed the water in those holes was nice and filtered by the dirt and sand. If they dug a hole and covered it up, their water would taste good and stay clear of leaves, sticks, and algae. So they dug deeper and deeper holes, and found they could move further from lakes and rivers which would flood from time to time.   Where to dig a well was trickier the further you got from water though. Sometimes they dug big holes for nothing, and that was disappointing, but they learned a lot from it. Parents taught their children what to look for, what kinds of rocks and plants made for good well ground.  EDIT: WHOA!!! Glad so many people were amused by writing in my teacher-voice! A recurring question I\u2019ve seen is \u201cHow can dirt filter water? Wouldn\u2019t it be dirty?\u201d So here\u2019s a [link](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/groundwater-wells?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) to explain more about wells since it\u2019s a pretty deep subject. In short, fine topsoil rich in organic matter doesn\u2019t go very deep, clay settles out, and gravel and sand are excellent filters that continue to be used as part of modern water filtration systems.",
    "follow-up": "This procedure works so well that exceptions to it are worth noting.  When europeans settled the lower Chesapeake Bay, they had real trouble getting to fresh water.  They dug tons of wells and they invariably turned up brackish water, even those far enough away from the bay itself that contamination shouldn't have been a problem.  This made no sense - Virginia has tons of rain and streams, why were wells so unproductive?    This was temporarily solved by moving a bit farther away from the bay where well-digging worked fine, but the mystery wasn't solved until fairly recently.  Turns out that the lower Chesapeake was formed when a massive meteor hit the place around 35 million years ago.  The obvious signs of a big crater were eventually obscured so nobody noticed it, but the event had so shattered the local geology that it made it difficult to form those nice lenses of fresh water that wells tap into.",

    "answer": "There are two concepts and it can get conflated.  Humans MEASURING time is completely a human construct. What we call hours, minutes and seconds are simply measurements of time. Time \"exists\" independent of whether humans exists - and one way to look at it is that time separates cause from effect. When some thing causes another thing to happen, then it occurs earlier (as we term it) than the result it causes.  As to relativity, this is again easy to get wrapped in confusion. Say you can read a book in an hour while sitting here on earth. Now we put you on a really fast spaceship headed away from earth and gave you that same book to read. Do you read it faster or slower? Actually, from YOUR perspective, it takes an hour to read as it did when you were on earth. Your LOCAL perspective of time does not change regardless of how fast you travel. To an observer on earth, though, it appears TO THEM, that you read the book slower in the spaceship than when you were sitting next to them on earth.   The simplest explanation is that since the spaceship is travelling away from the other observer, the time taken for light to travel gets longer and longer. Say something takes 1 second from start to finish from the spaceship's perspective. The light that travels from the start of the event travels a shorter distance than the light travelling at the end of the event to the observer. To the observer, this makes it appear as though the time from start to finish took longer to occur on the spaceship than 1 second.",
    "follow-up": "Thank you this is really helpful. If you were to theoretically travel on a train on earth approaching the speed of light, would the effect be the same, or does the distance from the observer matter as well?

    "question": "eli5 Is oxygen the only problem climbing Mt. Everest?",
    "answer": "There is quite the large misconception about \"lack of oxygen\" and \"temperature\" when it comes to climbing Mt. Everest, in that the real technical problem with it is actually the air pressure.  If you've ever been in an airplane, or a fast elevator, you probably experienced a stark change to how your ears hear stuff while either going up or down (a lot less prominent ***while*** flying, but as it happened to me at least twice, I'm not gonna knock it out either). That's the atmospheric pressure affecting your body, which causes a plethora of changes. Eardrums \"popping\" is one of the least bad while climbing the big mountain, and you go up so slowly that you might not even have that one at all, but...  The human body is meant to survive at around 1 atm (read: \"atmosphere\", which is the average Earth's air pressure at sea level, assuming a temperature of 15\u00b0C/59\u00b0F.) A great example of something that can happen if you lower the pressure outside, is that the force that contains your tissues and cells together is now fighting against less force to contain it, which may cause them to swell, and create a plethora of ***really bad symptoms***, such as headaches, nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath (made worse for it being harder to breathe in the same amount of oxygen), and with longer exposure, can lead to cough, vomiting and confusion.  This is called, colloquially, as \"Mountain Sickness\" or \"Altitude Sickness\", and is one of the first big warnings when you get serious about climbing Mt. Everest, basically is the main misconception about the lack of oxygen up there, and why while it does help in some cases, it's not just a matter of bringing an oxygen tank and calling it a day.  Now, for the temperature issue: Yes, it's cold up there. It definitely is. But the problem with stating that as a factoid is also quite problematic, since technically, the air being less dense means you'll lose less body heat to the ambient air. That's the good news.  The bad news is, however, that you'll lose more of it to the snowy ground, and since your tissues tend to be swollen, you will also face an increased bloodflow, your heat-sensitive blood is now more likely to be exposed to the air, which paradoxically makes ot easier for you to lose heat in the thinner atmosphere... So, I guess my line about losing less heat to the ambient air was a bit misleading.  Also worth noting: Your sweat will be doing a much poorer job at regulating our body temperature, since liquids boil (and thus evaporate) at a lower temperature point when at lower pressure/higher altitude...  Now, I sure that at least one detail I've said here may have been debunked in some way, but that's how I was explained it in high school.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do \"red skies at morning\" mean it's going to storm later that day?",
    "answer": "It has to do with the scattering of incoming solar radiation. It is called Rayleigh scattering. the way weather systems travel is from west to east.   The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Incoming solar radiation deflected sideways at an angle. If that angle is high then it brings about blue skies and such. If there is a blue sunrise that, to me, as a weather forecaster tells me I have low pressure to my east. The storm has passed.   As a result of low pressure being to my east, I will have high pressure to my west. High pressure is associated with good weather and great conditions. The high pressure is to come and move over my station.   High pressure brings about a low sun angle because it condenses the atmosphere. This low sun angle gives us our red sunrises and sunsets.  Edit: This is more of a mid latitude United States phenomenon. I decided to give it another shot\u2014 see below  Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.    Cool.   If at any point the sun rise or sun set is the color orange, red, or pink it can be inferred that the atmosphere is being condensed under the influence of high pressure. Because the sun is low in the sky and the atmosphere is condensed this is used to locate where high pressure is. Whether it is departing or arriving to you.   On the other hand, low pressure within the atmosphere allows it to expand. Therefore, wherever low pressure is located the sky at sun rise and sun set will not appear the colors aforementioned but will be your usual blue sky. This is due to the lack of condensation in the atmosphere. It allows the blue to be seen instead of the other colors on the visible spectrum.   In the mid latitudes (not the equator or the poles) between 60 degrees N and 30 degrees N there is the polar front jet (jet stream) that is high in the sky and it helps high pressure and low pressure move across mid latitudes in a west to east fashion as this is the only way the wind travels in the polar front jet. So this is the way low pressure systems (more commonly frontal boundaries) move with high pressure ahead and behind the fronts.   Weather is fluid and ever changing. What one may understand may be understood differently by another.",

If that truck sinks into the mud, then I'll buy a different truck for $75 so that my $150 isn't wasted.\" The pattern then repeats.  In your specific conversation, the fact that you bought the investment means it is indeed a \"sunk cost\"; the fact that you aren't getting the same money back means it is sunk. If you spend more money on the investment just because you have the investment and are hoping it pays off, you are probably doing a \"sunk cost fallacy\". As a term it is entirely different from profit.

In your scenario, if a replacement boat will cost another $100 it may be perfectly rational to spend $50 to rent a truck and pull it out if the additional cost of repairs is less than another $50.    So let's say, like in your scenario, the 1st truck gets stuck in the mud.  Should you spend $75 on a more powerful truck to get your boat out?

    "answer": "A Turing machine is a \"state machine\" (also called finite automata) that pilot an head that can move, read and write through an infinite memory.  The tricky part is that all the power of a Turing machine is hidden in the notion of state machine. State machines can make conditional, they can loop, they can do pretty much everything you can imagine doing with algorithms.  Their only true restriction is that they are very limited in memory, and the Turing machine adds that.  Even then, there is still some \"kinds of computations\" that mathematically exists but that a Turing machine can't do. But they're all of the kind \"do this infinitely often THEN after this infinite amount of actions do this other thing\" so not considered physically possible. In particular, I believe that if we invent time travel, there are a few kind of computations that we would be able to do but that Turing machine can't, but I'm not 100% sure on that.  So the thing is, up until know, everything we were able to compute with some real device, we can see the decice as a State machine together with some additional memory, and \"state machine with memory\" can be written as a Turing machine. (Assuming you're not taking absurd kinds of memories, like single cells of memories where you can stores infinitely long numbers)",

    "answer": "Here you go:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory  Why is it making headlines? Many schools are revamping their curriculum.  My opinion is that one group wants true history being taught. i.e. slaves were not immigrants. Native Americans were here first. And another group wants to teach American exceptionalism and not teach the negative parts of US history.   Many conservatives claim that Critical Race Theory teaches that all white people are racist and that white people should all feel guilty.   I disagree and think that those ideas are more from the books White Fragility and How to be Anti Racist.   Critical Race Theory is a legal / law school topic. I don\u2019t know anyone that\u2019s being taught this in K-12.   Black History,Native American history and US history should be taught honestly and accurately.   Teaching that all whites are racist and all blacks are oppressed is not productive and not something I can honestly say is occurring. At least not with any parents that I know.  ETA: I also think the 1619 Project by Hannah Nicole Jones has ruffled a lot of feathers. Her article has been challenged by historians and many say it\u2019s flat out historically incorrect. But there are other essays and articles that are part of the 1619 Project that are fact based and accurate. I think some schools say that they were going to start teaching the 1619 Project.

    "question": "ELI5: How are credit/debit cards with chips more secure than others when most card readers have a \"Bypass PIN\" option that allows the transaction to go through without any additional verification? It seems to me that this is less secure than an old chipless card that at least requires a PIN.",
    "answer": "The chip and/or the PIN are a means of verifying the transaction is legit.  On a card without the chip, the only data is its number, the expiration date, and maybe the verification code on the back. The magnetic stripe is usually just the card number. These kinds of terminals require the PIN because (hopefully) only the authorized cardholder knows that PIN. These cards are easy to duplicate so we NEED extra security measures.  Cards with a chip, on the other hand, are a lot harder to replicate. The chip is actually a tiny computer that does some math on some inputs and generates numbers in a way that isn't easy to guess even if you see it done for a few thousand inputs. The bank who issues the card knows the secret information that makes it possible to predict the numbers. So, oversimplified, when you use a chip reader, the terminal gives the chip some inputs, gets the chip's result, then sends the inputs and the results to the bank. The bank verifies that the inputs should produce that output on your chip. So in a way, the chip IS the PIN, but it's more secure than that because you can't accidentally give someone knowledge that makes them able to replicate your chip.  It's probably possible to copy a card with a chip, but it would take a high degree of sophistication and someone would have to physically steal your card to do it. You can't reproduce the chip from observing a single read, and in theory even seeing hundreds of thousands of input/output wouldn't be useful. Because it's incredibly close to impossible to duplicate these chips, when a terminal uses the chip as an ID you don't have to use a PIN. The assumption is it means someone would've had to have stolen your actual card and you'd probably notice that much more quickly than it takes to figure out someone's skimmed a traditional card.",

Digital art has only been around for a few decades, and while plenty of people make a living off of digital art designing websites and graphics etc, you don\u2019t hear about digital art being sold for millions of dollars really.  This is because part of what makes art valuable/collectible to some people is it\u2019s rarity, the fact that you can own something that is the only thing in the world like it.  NFTs have tried/are trying to do that, that is the whole \u201cnon-fungible\u201d part.

Nothing in my body, including bacteria, are going to be good at digesting it, so it's just going to make its way through my digestive system and out the other end intact.  No gas.   On the other hand, eating more beans might mean that your body starts to develop more bacteria in your gut that *are* good at digesting specific parts of beans, even if your own body isn't.  And one of the byproducts of them digesting beans is gas, usually CO2 and sometimes methane.   So I would think that having more efficient bacteria would mean more gas, not less.

    "answer": "OpenID Connect is an extension of Oauth, so the OpenID Connect protocol is to perform (a version of) the Oauth protocol, but with some additional information passed along. So to answer your last question, any time you're using OpenID Connect, you are, in a sense, using both Oauth and OpenID Connect at the same time   The specifics of the different protocols is beyond ELI5, but broadly speaking, Oauth is useful for authorization while OpenID Connect is useful for authentication. Authorization is the practice of determining whether someone is allowed to do something (e.g. checking the permissions on a file before a user opens it is authorization). Authentication is the practice of determining that someone is who they say they are (e.g. asking for a password is authentication).  Oauth revolves around the \"access token\". An access token indicates that the bearer has access to certain resources or scopes. It performs authorization, but not authentication. How do we know that this access token is coming from a certain user, and not, for example, an app that the user granted access to? We don't! And that's by design in Oauth.  OpenID Connect introduces the \"ID token\", which the Authorization Server (now called the \"Identity Provider\" in OpenID Connect terms) passes to the client alongside the access token. This ID token contains basic user information, like their name or email address as well as a creation and expiration time. It performs authentication, but not authorization. Having an ID token indicates that a particular person is logged in at a particular time. But how do we know what that user has permission to do? We don't! (not just with the ID token anyway, that's what the access token is for).  This skips over a lot of nitty-gritty, but I hope it helps!",

We have 2 types of Diabetes:   Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus T2DM).  The Eli5 would be:  T1DM: For reasons that we don't fully understand, the body uses the immune system to destroy parts of the pancreas that create Insulin.

It starts during childhood.  T2DM: In this case, the body is able to create insulin, but for reasons (That we don't fully understand) the body develops \"insulin resistance\". It means despite insulin being present, the cells do not get the message. Blood sugar goes high and causes many complications.

    "answer": "If you have, say, a million bucks and you want to buy a house.  If I tell you inflation is 2% and the house is likely gonna be more expensive next year, you are unlikely to wait for any reason, and will purchase the house NOW.  If I say that deflation is 2% and the house will be cheaper next year, you're probably just gonna wait this one out. That money in your bank, just sitting, is money that could have gone to the labourers, the insurance and property agents, the people selling the home, etc. By keeping that money in the bank, you're effectively preventing people from getting paid, because you're trying to follow your economic self-interest.  If everyone starts to do this, then everyone will hold on to their money, and the lack of transactions will cause everyone to get paid less, hurting everyone in the economy.  EDIT: I don't really want to go about criticising other people here, but honestly, all talks about deflation being good and politicians, the government, etc etc conspiring to convince you of the opposite should spend less time on the weird parts of the internet. Regardless of what the global banking conspiracy documentaries have told you, deflation is bad 99 times out of 100.",
    "follow-up": "This is a good answer, and makes sense.  The question and response got me thinking about inflation vs deflation.  I have a few thoughts, and would like to hear what you, and others, think...  1.  How would a potential home buyer know if prices were going to be 2% higher or 2% lower next year?  Speculation?  Based on past trends of the past year?  Is it truly the results of higher/lower prices that impact peoples' decisions, or simply sentiment from past trends?  2.  If someone is in the market to purchase something expensive, it's probably because they have a near term need for that item.  In the case of a house, unless it's an investment (or not a primary residence), I can't see delaying a purchase for a year because it will (or may) be cheaper in the future.  If I can wait a year to purchase a house, my million dollars could be expected to safely make 5-10% gains while invested, so assuming prices change by 2% in either direction, I will benefit by waiting as long as possible to make the purchase.  If purchasing via a mortgage (not cash), the equation will change.  3.  Most people rely on hourly wages, salary, or a fixed income.  If the cost of goods consistently increases, their income will need to increase an equal amount for their purchasing power to remain constant.  If prices decrease, a person's income would be able to purchase more.  This, more valuable, money would probably still be spent, and not lead to a decrease in income for people selling goods.  If a person, or company, earns the same number of dollars selling goods/services as the previous year, while 2% deflation occurs, their net income increases (their COGS are lower), and each dollar of that income is able to purchase more.  4.  Wealthy people who have significant money invested will likely continue to earn more on their money as a %, than the percentage of inflation.  Their investment accounts will grow in relation to the cost of goods/services, while the invested money is not being spent or circulated.  This is seemingly not helping the economy, since a greater portion of the dollars in \"circulation\" are not moving.  I'm not an economist, and am truly interested in hearing other peoples' opinions on the above.  I have no sources to cite, as these are just random thoughts.  I don't know what the right answer is regarding inflation vs deflation, but my brain can't get over the fact that it would be better for my money to be able to purchase more than less...

    "answer": "Hi :-)   The radio spectrum is like constantly hearing a giant, very distant Orchester practicing quietly. You can't really make out any melody, direction, single instrument.     Even if you use an old fashioned ear tube all you get is random \"noise\".  The Wow! signal would be like one instrument suddenly playing so loud that you instantly knew it wasn't like the others. The notes were slightly different, too.   (As for the radio signals, they were close to the hydrogen line, ~1420MHz)   In a \"heat map\" you can see the signal as \"blip\" standing out from the usual noise. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wow_signal_spectrogram.svg  What makes it special as well is that it could not be traced back to something else (like satellites or a colleges' microwave).  A lot of things make \"radio noise\". Pulsars, comets, Jupiter... Even just the big lumps of hydrogen gas chilling in space. But we know of many of these, and can rule them out.",

    "question": "eli5: What's the difference between an ARM and an x86 CPU?",
    "answer": "ARM and x86 are [instruction set architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) (ISAs). An ISA can be thought of as a \"programming language\" specification for CPUs: it defines the interface for how you talk to the CPU and what you should expect out of it.  ARM is a reduced instruction set ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)) architecture, while x86 is a complex instruction set ([CSIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer)) architecture. The ELI5 version of that is x86 has way more instructions in its language, and the shape and behavior of those instructions are far more complicated.  For example, x86 instructions are variable-length, meaning the instruction decoder needs to read each byte to determine how many more bytes to read next in order to decode the instruction.  The x86 ISA also has instructions that can manipulate memory directly, while in ARM, you would have to perform all operations on registers before storing those registers back to memory with an appropriate instruction. Technically it's an abstraction, since under the hood, the CPU may well be loading the memory location into a hidden register, performing the requested operation on it, and then store it back to memory, but to you it looks like one instruction.  TL;DR, you can think of them as different programming languages, where x86 has more language features, at the expense of complexity.",

But ac power is used because you can change voltage with a transformer with no moving parts and minimal points of failure.  Transformers are basically just iron plates held near each other without touching. The AC current causes a magnetic field and even though the line and load don't touch each other this creates a power in the load side of a different voltage.  This is how we get 110v or 230v  from our homes despite power plants making stuff like 10000 volts for the main lines.",

    "answer": "When you're extinct, you're gone. There is no \"re-emerging\" because there is nothing to re-emerge from. It's like asking why a person doesn't come back to life after you've removed the bullet that killed them from their brain. Dead is dead.  But not all dinosaurs went extinct. Notably, they survive today as birds. Why didn't birds, then, become \"dominant?\"  This begs the question of what it means to be \"dominant.\" More often than not, humans define \"dominant\" by the traits humans happen to have (tool use, cooperation, intelligence, technology, ability to manipulate our environment). But that's just circular. There are a number of ways in which we *aren't* dominant:  Live on earth for the longest duration? Cyanobacteria.  Total biomass? Antarctic krill.  Longevity? Plenty of species are biologically immortal.  Biggest impact on the environment? Maybe humans, historically, probably cyanobacteria again.  Even the manner in which we divide up living organisms into species is based on manmade constructs. In reality, nature doesn't quite conform to the nice discrete boxes we have made for it.  Setting aside the question of human's dominance, it's probably less contentious to say that mammals in general saw quite a degree of success (success being measured by reproductive success and the explosion of new species and areas occupied) following the fall of the dinosaurs and we can attribute that to a number of reasons:  * Being small and fur-covered, mammals are better adapted to cooler climates, and the earth entered a cooling period after the extinction of the dinosaurs. * The elimination of many large dinosaur species created power vacuums that mammals filled. * Process of elimination. Generally speaking you have: mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Reptiles, fish, and amphibians are pretty tied to specific environments, leaving  most of land free to the mammals and birds.",

    "answer": "As a truck driver, scales usually aren't more than a small inconvinence as long as you planned ahead and checked your axle weights before hitting the road. Being caught overweight can be incredibly expensive and also can put you out of service until you or your company can remedy the situation.   With DOT scales I am mostly concerned about axle weights. Your load may be under maximum payload for the truck but overweight on one or more axles. Interstate scales typically measure each axle group individually. In general weights max 12,000 lbs for the front axle 34,000 lbs for the rear truck axles a 34,000 lbs for the trailer axles (on most trucks). It can get much more complicated with oversize/overweight heavy hauling and other specialized trucks and trailer.   Most trailers have the ability to slide the trailer axles forward and back and trucks usually can slide the 5th wheel to help you distribute the weight properly over all the axles.     I do scale with most loads before hitting the road at the nearest truck stop if the shipper doesn't have one on location. Most truck stops have scales for $10-12 and you can re-weigh for about $2 if you need to adjust the load or truck. Fuel weight must also be taken into consideration. I have also scaled my truck empty as well to get a baseline weight so I have an idea of what my payload weight can be before arriving at the shipper.",

    "answer": "A little late to the game but as someone that trains people how to driver tractor trailers here's my take.   While as a lot of people are correct in commenting for weight, there are a lot of other things ports check. Permits; in certain states you have to have a long combination vehicle permit to pull more than two 28's or a single 45 or 53. They also check hours of service, a semi driver can not drive more than 11 consecutive hours in any 24 hour period. They perform what are called roadside inspections for violations of the actual vehicle, brake thickness, wipers, lights, tires, tire chains in the Northern states, steering, etc. Port employees can take a driver put of service for any violations.   For the overweight trailer question. The port can instruct you to offload freight but that usually doesn't happen unless you are grossly overweight. Typically you just get a ticket, but they can make you offload to another vehicle if necessary. Coming from a company and area that can pull overlength sets of trailers, we typically \"drop\". What that means if we're pulling triple 28's or double 45's we have to leave a trailer at the port and another driver has to come retrieve it. Not all companies have the license to do this and the state decides if the roads can handle overlength/overweight trailers.   Source: I train drivers not to do any of things I just listed above.

    "answer": "edit: below is an explanation of how *e* naturally comes up in math and physics, assuming solid end of high school math level, ignore if you are looking for an actual 5 yo explanation, ty.   It's quite natural to wonder what are the functions where the values (=position, intensity, number of smth) are proportional to the derivative (=speed, slope, growth). Many important phenomenons like bank interest, inflation, virus propagation, cell proliferation, population growth when unchecked, nuclear chain reaction and nuclear decay behave according to that.   So mathematically, that is f'=af. Where a is a constant, the growth rate. Easiest is to take a=1 for starters, so f'=f. You see that if a function f is a solution to this equation, b\\*f is also a solution, for any constant b, so we can just solve for the simplest case f(0)=1 and just find all other solutions for f(0)=b by multiplying the solutions by b. Finally, if we look for a solution with a Taylor series, i.e. of the form f(x)=f(0)+f'(0)\\*x +f''(0)/2!\\*x^2 + ... + f^(n) (0)/n!\\*x^n + ..., it all simplifies because the derivatives f^(n) (0) are all 1, so we get a nice solution for f, useful to compute valued to any precision, namely f(x)=sum_n(x^n /n!). In particular we can compute to any accuracy f(1) and we call this number e. The function f we call it exponential or exp.  We can further see that exp(x+y) = exp(x)\\*exp(y), so we can start from f(1)=e and get f(2)=e^2 and more generally f(n)=f(1+1+...+1)=e^n , using the classical definition of integer powers (multiply n times by). Since we have a way to compute f also for non-integer numbers, with the polynomial development above, we can use this to continuously and naturally extend the definition of powers to all real numbers, so we can just write exp(x)=e^x . And if we come back to the equation above with f'=af and f(0)=b, simple to see f(x)=b\\*e^(ax) are the solutions we were looking for.   With all that we see that the number e has a really central and natural position in math and physics, and that it was unavoidable that it is found by any population developing calculus sooner or later. We also see there are simple ways to compute numerical approximations of it, for ex with the polynomial development above.",

    "question": "ELI5 where does the money go when markets are down?",
    "answer": "Into different classes of assets, typically gold, government bonds, anything that investors view as more stable. That said, the *reason* markets are down is usually because of a sweeping price correction, ie: something people had *thought* was worth a lot of money suddenly turns out to be worth far less.  When times are \"good\" and everyone thinks they're getting rich, they'll be able to spend more money bidding up the price of investments, because that's generally the smartest thing to do with your money: Invest it into something which will earn you more money. The problem occurs when there's a new class of investment which appears to be \"too good to be true\". Dot.com stocks in 2001, Mortgage-backed securities in 2008, are good examples of this.  John Maynard Keynes, the economist for whom \"Keynesian Economics\" is named, uses a metaphor to describe the stock market: The [beauty contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest):  >Keynes described the action of rational agents in a market using an analogy based on a fictional newspaper contest, in which entrants are asked to choose the six most attractive faces from a hundred photographs. Those who picked the most popular faces are then eligible for a prize.  So, everyone is trying to guess what the most popular faces will be, not necessarily the faces they actually think are the most attractive. This phenomenon is how bubbles form. Many investors will put money into a bubble, on the undertaking that they're better off pumping their money with everyone else caught up in the enthusiasm, then dumping their position at the peak of the buying hysteria. Of course, that means timing is very important. Wait too long, and you can lose your stake on a wildly overinflated bubble, and fundamentally, the people holding bubble stocks are buying them on the hope they can find someone gullible enough to buy the stocks at their now-inflated price.  So, how does a bubble pop? Why can't everyone just keep trading back shares and making more and more money? Because investments are still tied to real things, and if those real things cease to exist, then the investment becomes worthless. So, if you have $100 in ABC stock, and ABC announces that they're going into bankruptcy restructuring because they're deeply in debt, suddenly your $100 worth of stock is worth much, much less, because it turns out the company you own is about to not exist.  This is what happened in 2008, and 2001. In both cases, the underlying asset people had bought shares in simply disappeared. The borrowers defaulted on their loans in 2008, and the dot.com businesses which weren't making profits closed, and the securities backed by these entities were suddenly worth nothing.  If this is an isolated company that's folding, no big deal, right? The people who are left holding worthless paper get hosed, but everyone else is unaffected. But when this starts to happen a *lot*, suddenly people who've been spending money based on overvalued assets are struck with a reality-check are unable to make payments. So, after your $100 worth of ABC stock vanished, you responsibly decide to stop your subscription for company DEF. In the next quarter, DEF reports that their revenue has dropped, and the putative value of DEF has dropped because it's now a less profitable company. Now the people holding DEF stock cut some expenses, and reduce the revenue of company GHI, and so on.  What's important to recognize is that economies are *reciprocal*. They call it the economic engine, after all. Your income is my expense, and vice-versa. When we all stop spending money, we all stop earning money, and suddenly everyone's cashflow gets tighter.",
    "follow-up": "Agree, but the idea that all bubbles must pop when the underlying asset goes belly up is still only an assumption.  We are assuming that rational investors won't pay for overvalued assets.  But they were always technically overvalued (since they were going to go out of business eventually as we now know), there was just a point at which rational actors could no longer ignore that the asset had less/no value.    So you have to draw a line in the sand over what type of information will confirm that the asset's value has changed.  If I'm a financial genius who is laser focused on a particular asset and industry, maybe I recognize it is valueless early, and maybe for the causal investor it becomes valueless when WSJ says it's going under.  But we still are assuming that the line at which it loses value is when a significant number of people come to that realization. Most trades are placed by professionals who largely share a common view of what is market rational, and their view dictates when value is lost because their trades dictate the market price.  Their lemming nature put us in the bubble for the reason you describe.  But take Pomemon cards, who is the rational investor there?  People who really understand Charizard?  My point being that bubbles don't have to pop.  Ever.  Not if they are based on what we consider traditionally irrational behavior like faith, love in the stock qua the stock (trading cards), the lulz (GME), etc.  America doesn't pop maybe because of nationalistic American exceptionalism.  Who is to say that won't be true of Amazon someday when people come to believe the company is part of the fabric of their lives to the point that no amount of \"rational\" information about their ability to generate future revenue impacts the belief that their stock is valuable?

Water is what\u2019s called a polar molecule, since the oxygen exerts a stronger pull on the shared electrons then the hydrogen atoms, the oxygen atom is slightly negative, and the hydrogen atom is slightly positive.  This same effect happens in things like sugar and ethanol, which also have some O-H bonds. These polar molecules then all have intermolecular attractive forces between them, which allows whatever your dissolving to get pulled into and spread out through the water.  MnO2 doesn\u2019t have these properties, and acts the same something like Rust, Fe02 would, it doesn\u2019t do much.

However if you do this too quickly, you're suddenly causes a big spike in the load for the engine, and the engine simply cannot produce enough power to spin the wheels instantly.   When you lift the clutch slower, the clutch starts gently applying force to the wheels, allowing it to slowly come up to speed, instead of everything being dumped at once.   So you're spreading out the work the engine has to do to make the car move over a longer period of time, which is easier for the engine to do.   It's like asking you to lift 100kg or to lift 10kg 10 times, the latter is much easier to do.   This is also why diesel engines stall less easily, because they produce more torque.

BA's can also help testers define their test cases around the same use cases/user stories so that the features can be properly tested to ensure they meet the business' requirements.

    "answer": "It's all contained in the name.  When someone is virtue signaling they want to signal to other people (signal when used in this context means to show, indicate, convince, prove to, etc.  So they want to show to other people....) that you are virtuous (so virtuous means that you have a belief, an ideal or possess a quality that is believed to be a good thing like caring for the sick and/or homeless as one example) that you really don't possess.  That last part is important because it's why this term has come to be used.  Basically when someone is accused of virtue signaling people are saying they're lying about giving a shit about whatever virtue they're displaying.  For example, someone could easily show pictures of them giving something to a homeless person.  This would signal that they care about homeless people or even people in general.  However they may not give any fucks about the homeless or people in  general.....they simply want everyone to believe they do.

If we take WW2 as an example the French surrendered to the Germans after taking very little casualties compared to how large their military was.  The Germans out outmaneuvered the French and got behind them and at this point the French knew that they could either pull back and let even more German troops invade France or stay put and hold those troops off but let the Germans who had got past them run all over France.  Realising that all they had left were bad choices they surrendered.  Germany got what they wanted which was getting the French out of the war and having a rather large say in what France now did.  On paper the French should have won.  They had the more powerful military.  A state of war exists when a country declares war on another.

You HOPE that the price lowers so you can pocket the difference. Example: If you borrow a stock from me, and sell for \u00a310, you want the price to lower. That way when the time comes to return it back to me, you buy it for the lower price of \u00a35, give it back to me, and you pocket the extra \u00a35.  To quickly go into what happened with GME, the hedgefunds borrowed ALL THE STOCKS that exists, AND THEN MORE STOCKS on top of that, thinking that the price of GME was gonna drop. In fairness, the Price had been in freefall for years and GameStop has been on its last legs for a long time. Smart people on Reddit noticed this, and brought all the stocks, which pushed the prices up. To translate this into the example: they borrowed and sold for $10 a share (not the correct price), but the price went up to about $300 per share. This put the hedgefunds in deficit by $290 per share (about $6Billion total). They had also borrowed more stocks than actually existed.

    "answer": "The other comments have pointed out the strict mathematical definitions, but in practice, something is Turing-complete if it can do three things: read data, write data, and perform \"if\" instructions (e.g. if the data says x, do instruction A next, otherwise, do instruction B).  If something can do all three of those things, then they technically have enough power to do anything any other computer can. Whether it can do it at the same speed or not, well, Turing completeness makes no promises about speed.  An analogy to Turing completeness would be like if there was something called \"math complete\", which checked if a language could do all mathematical operations.  If there was a language that could perform addition on any number, then it would be \"math complete\". Why? Because it can simulate subtraction by changing the second number to negative (e.g. it can do 8 - 5 by performing 8 + -5). It can simulate multiplication by adding repeatedly (e.g. it can do 2 * 3 by performing 2 + 2 + 2). It can simulate division by counting how many times it needs to add to reach a number (e.g. it can do 6 \u00f7 2 by performing 2 + 2 + 2 and observing that it takes three 2s to make 6).  A language that can only do addition is slower and longer than a language that can do all mathematical operations, but it can still get the answer at the end of the day.  Likewise, something that is Turing-complete can compute anything any other Turing-complete computer can calculate. It may be slower and its instructions may be much longer and much more complicated, but there will be an equivalent way to write instructions for it to perform the same calculation another computer can do.",

But regardless yes it is more difficult than a car:  Controls: Steering is far more like a boat than like car only you have elevation as well. I'm sure other redditors will go into greater detail but your controls are far more complex and if you are relying on the auto pilot you need to understand how to read and program that specific autopilot exactly. You can't learn to fly a Boeing 737-400 and then go fly a Boeing 737-800 - you'd have to go specifically retrain (Boeing 737NG course).  Navigation: In a car you are driving on a road with road markings and road signs and nowadays with extremely an useful GPS lady to guide you along. A huge part of flying is navigating as there's no signs up in the air to guide you along. And with weather conditions you have to learn to navigate by instrumentation alone.  Radio: This is the reason I could never be a pilot - I do not understand what is being said over the radio and you cannot fly safely without having proper communication and radio discipline. You have to be listening closely at **all** times because there's no way to fly safely without listening out for air traffic control constantly.  Safety: If your aircraft experiences any problem in air you can't simple pull over and open the hood. Therefore every single of aspect of flying involves safety checks and doublechecks.

The sensor needs to get power from electricity wires and it also needs a data cable coming out of it. Where you you put all these wires? Do you put them on the light-sensitive side, right between the sensor and the lens where the light comes in? Of course not, that would be ridiculous! The wires would be in the way and make all sorts of shadows on the light sensor that would ruin the pictures!   Except, that's exactly how it works for the retina: all of the blood vessels and neurons are on the wrong side, so the light has to pass through them first before it gets to the light-sensitive cells. Not only that, but the neurons, finding themselves inside a closed-off eyeball, need to burrow through that eyeball in order to connect to the brain. And that's why we have a blind spot in each eye: it's where the optic nerve goes through the retina in order to get out of the eye, and so there are no light-sensitive cells there. And yes, those nerves and (especially) blood vessels do cast shadows - your brain just filters them out (but there are ways to make them visible).   This is some of the clearest evidence of evolution, or at least the absence of a designer, that I know of. No one would make it that way by design - it's bonkers. But evolution works in small steps, always building off what came before. And that's exactly how you *can* end up with something like this. Or more precisely: with that kind of incremental optimization, it's simply too big of a jump to go from this to the optimal solution, which would be to completely flip the layers of the retina. Too much would have to change all at once for that to happen, and so evolution cannot progress in that direction. Besides: the current solution still works - it just requires some hacks. Biology is full of stuff like that.

In general SEO is a big and complex industry. It is often a war between the search engines trying to give their users relevant content and the SEO companies trying to promote their content.

    "answer": ">eli5 If the speed of electricity is 1/C per second (Thanks Veritasium), how come typical internet latency is astronomically bigger in the milliseconds range?      Last time I connected to a New York server the latency was about **100ms**.    The distance from Central Europe to New York is about 6000km. There is no straight line connection from me to there so let's add a 50% margin for extra cable length - 9000km of routing equipment, copper and fiber optics.   Latency is given for the signal to travel there and back, so a total travel distance of 18000km.   c is 300000km/s so light in a vacuum would travel the 18000km in about **60ms**.   The signal doesn't travel at that speed through fiber and copper though, only at a high-double-digit fraction of c.       Add to that the possible overhead from quality of service operations and routing equipment compute times and about a 100ms ping would seem like *exactly* what you'd expect - not at all an astronomical discrepancy.",
    "follow-up": "Indeed, practically we're pretty damn close, to the point that stock exchanges sell fibres and datacentre space just short distances from their central network because those are fractions of a millisecond closer and thus people can \"trade\" even quicker because the signal has less distance to cover.  It's ridiculous, but those millionths of a second are tangible to some traders and they will pay millions to get the shortest quickest cable to the exchange.  Given the amount of intermediary equipment, boosting, conversion (light to electricity to light to electricity to a different electrical cable, through a semiconductor at a clocked rate, back out to a cable, back to light, etc. etc. etc.), processing, filtering, repeating, copying, etc. that happens on that journey to a simple data stream, and dozens or even hundreds of times in the same journey, not to mention that I don't have a direct cable to Microsoft so I'm probably going through all kinds of major cities and continents and non-optimal routes to get there because the cabling (fibre and electrical) is far more convenient to arrange in an arrangement of \"hubs\" in major cities and on coastlines to transit across oceans, etc. we do pretty damn well to get almost exactly the portion of c that you'd expect to be theoretically possible.  Hell, even your wifi \"moves\" at the speed of light, as purely as it possibly can in practical terms.  The fact is that your wifi / cable / fibre is only \"oscillating\" that signal at a given speed / frequency, and that's the limiting factor for you.  If the circuit can only oscillate to represent that data at, say, 54Mb/s (or 10Gb/s, or whatever the technology you're using \"oscillates\" at to carry the data on), there's only so much data it can transmit in a given time, no matter how instantaneously those oscillations get to the other side of the world.  That's where the limit lies, and the more devices it goes through, the more you're limited by that, and the more likely that you'll catch the edge of the last oscillation during a conversion and have to wait around for the next one before you can transmit the next bit.  Those all add up and, aside from the actual speed of light, are one of the main causes of delay.  Processing your signal is what slows it down.  And it gets processed possibly thousands of times between you and the end point.  That it can do it that quickly AT ALL is pretty damn amazing, and we get within touching distance of the theoretical maximum.  Interesting fact:  Generally speaking, ordinary, room-temperature processors can't go much about 5GHz because at those frequencies the next bit of data is hitting one side of the chip before the other side of the chip has finished processing the last bit of data.  You can't keep a consistent \"clock\" across the entire surface of the chip.  Why?  Because that clock signal is an electrical signal.  And at the speed of light, and with the tiny size of modern microchips, the electrical signal literally barely gets time to traverse from one side of the chip (the \"input\") to the other (the \"output\") in the time it takes the processor to process that signal, and the next electrical signal is right behind it waiting to be processed.  That's why ordinary processors of almost all kinds for normal use basically stopped at 5GHz and never progressed.  We had enormous speed gains for decade after decade and then - bang.  Physics intervened.  The speed of light stopped us.  Anything beyond that speed requires far different conditions (e.g. far cooler temperatures, far smaller silicon wafers doing the processing, far more perfect conductors, or requires an asynchronous clock across the processor and that all makes things infinitely more complicated to manage).  And as it is, that 5GHz literally sits on the edge of what's possible in terms of electricity traversing a silicon wafer at the speed of light.",

    "answer": "It was the idea that we had somehow reached a time when all the important history stuff was done, the big wars and conflicts were resolved and new ones almost unimaginable, so some thought that politically, things would just continue to stay roughly the same forever. The idea has cropped up periodically throughout history, but most recently it was floated in the 90's. The Cold War had ended and even Russia was taking steps towards becoming a democratic nation and from a certain point of view, things just looked pretty good and stable, and it was imagine to see what could change that.  Of course it didn't happen because it was quite a naive idea; there will always be new world events happening. We may not have gotten a new world war (just yet), but we got Covid and Brexit and Russia's annexation of Crimea, and the Trump presidency and January 6 in the US, and 9/11 and climate change and.....  Another criticism of the idea is that it was very eurocentric. It was basically \"here in the western world, things look pretty settled. We have democracies and we're not at war, so surely things must be like this *everywhere*\", which completely ignores the rest of the world where other things were *always* happening. All the dictatorships and wars and coups and natural disasters happening elsewhere (often because of European or American meddling, even) weren't really taken into account, and even the rise of China and India wasn't really foreseen to create history, because, well, those countries are really far away and it's not really history unless it happens *here*, is it?",

    "answer": "Let's say you have a game that has objects. Well you generally don't want your objects passing through each other so you want the game to detect when two objects have \"collided\" so you can have them do things like explode or bounce off of each other. So you write some code for this \"collision detection.\"  Well, just about every game in the world has objects for which we need to detect collisions. So rather than every game studio in the world independently coming up with their own collision detection code from scratch, I'm just going to sell them mine. Saves them time and makes me money.  But just doing collusion detection wouldn't be efficient. So we add in just about all the stuff that's common to all games, or all games of a certain genre. Like applying gravity to objects, code for rending objects into the images you see on the screen, determining line of sight, etc. etc.  Take all of those common and ubiquitous functions that are applicable to lots of different games and package it up and now you have a game engine.  Now, buying a prepackaged game engine isn't *necessary* in the sense that you can still build a game without one, but in the end you'd just have to code all that stuff yourself anyway (basically building your own \"game engine\" piece by piece). Now if you want to build a game and not go insane doing it, and also maybe do it within your life time and to make a profit, then yes, using established game engines is pretty much a necessity.  There are many different game engines for two main reasons:  1. Some game engines are tailored for specific kind of genres. A game engine tailored for racing games will include different kinds of code than a game engine tailored for side scrollers or one tailored for first-person shooters. 2. People have different ideas of what kinds of functions or capabilities should be included in a game engine or how those functions or capabilities should be written in code.",

Basically the same method as what Romans used.  The amount of resources it takes to convert a population culturally is immense, and if you can control them without having to do that, it is a huge benefit.

In General Relativity, you don\u2019t really \u201cmove\u201d through time. Instead, you *are* at all points in time.   As an example with lower dimensions so we can understand it intuitively, imagine a pen moving left and right. Then, as time progresses, you move the page downward under the pen, leaving a line on that page.   The left/right position of that line on the paper represents the spacial position of the pen, while the up/down position represents the temporal position of the pen.   If you look at a single horizontal slice of that line, and you move the horizontal slice upwards at a steady rate, you will see what *looks* like a point moving left and right, imitating the path that your pen took.   But you know that the horizontal slice giving the motion of the pen is actually only a slice of the full picture. In fact, the ink of the pen makes a full line. It just *exists* in both time and space. It\u2019s not moving, it\u2019s not going forward or backward, it\u2019s just a line sitting there.   The only way to see motion from this line is by only looking at a single moving slice - a single moment in time - at any given instant.   This is what happens in real life. You are a 4-dimensional, static line through spacetime. The reason you seem to move, think, and be dynamic in any way is because you\u2019re experiencing a single slice of time, a single instant in your \u201cworldline\u201d (that\u2019s the real name for it), and that slice of time you experience is moving forward through time at 1 second per second.   Ok, but here\u2019s where it gets really weird.   How do you know that you\u2019re progressing through time? You\u2019re only ever living in the exact present, it\u2019s not like you have a sense that tells you time is passing, so how do you know it is?  Generally, the response is that you remember all the past instants in time, right? That layer of recent memories tells you you\u2019re moving through time, forming new memories.   But (assuming we accept that memories are due to some arrangement of matter in your brain, and not caused by magic or spirits or whatever), there\u2019s absolutely no way for you to differentiate between actually progressing through time and developing new memories, or just being a static entity that can\u2019t move, or do anything, that\u2019s stuck in a single instant in time, but with memories from all the previous instants.   Essentially, the idea is you aren\u2019t moving through time, you\u2019re stuck in this exact moment, but with the *memories* in your brain telling you that you are moving through time.   So now, the question isn\u2019t \u201cwhy are we only moving in one direction through time\u201d because in fact, you aren\u2019t moving through time at all. You\u2019re just a single static slice of your 4-dimensional worldline with the memories making you *think* you\u2019re moving through time. Rather, the question is \u201cwhy do we only remember the past, and not the future\u201d.   And the general idea for that is because of entropy. Let\u2019s pretend that your brain is a watermelon, and you\u2019re trying to remember a hammer that\u2019s coming to smash that watermelon.   Now, theoretically, it\u2019s within the laws of physics for a smashed watermelon to spontaneously bounce off the ground, join together, and throw a hammer into the air. It\u2019s *possible*, but insanely unlikely, because every one of billions of trillions of particles would have to vibrate in exactly the right way at the right time to accomplish that.   On the other hand, it\u2019s *very* likely for a watermelon hit by a hammer to spontaneously smash. That\u2019s something that increases entropy, and you have common sense to realize that would happen.   So, if we see a smashed watermelon, we can pretty easily conclude, \u201chey, a hammer probably hit this\u201d. If we see an *unsmashed* watermelon though, you can\u2019t conclude \u201cthis watermelon probably solidified from many small chunks of watermelon on the ground and threw a hammer into the air\u201d.   In a way, you can say a smashed watermelon \u201cremembers\u201d into the past that it was hit by a hammer.   On the other hand, a solid watermelon can\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d into the future that it *will be* smashed, because the probability that a solid, unsmashed watermelon corresponds to being hit by a hammer in the future is so vanishingly small.   Your brain is basically that watermelon. It can\u2019t remember into the future because it\u2019s so insanely unlikely that a brain affected by the future would somehow reverse every process required to, for example, erase a memory, send the signal back down the optic nerve, causing your cones to yeet out photons into space.   **TL;DR:** *You don\u2019t move through time at all, you\u2019re stuck in time with memory of the past. You only remember the past and not the future because entropy*",
    "follow-up": "I always liked this idea. I'll expand on it and include a bit of quantum mechanics.   We all heard of Schrodinger's cat: the state of a quantum system is undefined until \"measured\",  that is it's all things it can possibly be at the same time (i.e. superposition). This measurement thing really puts a lot of weight and importance on the observer. But why should an observer be so special? We discovered a lot of new physics assuming we're not special at all. And what does it mean to be in multiple states at once?  The answer to this are correlations. Just like the watermelon remembered the hammer because of the exchange of information between those systems, quantum systems become entangled with other systems interacting with it, living a sort of \"trace\" that now makes the combined worldline of observer+system coherent, singular, as to be consistent with each other.  Systems in superpositions are systems that are not strongly correlated with the rest of the universe and so can experience a myriad of possible worldlines.   In the words of the previous analogy, quantum systems are multiple streaks on a single paper; when a pen traces a line, it is \"forced\" to choose one of the lines already there, because all the possible lines are already traced.  In this interpretation, called \"many worlds\" (because you can think of multiple pens streaking all the lines), the observer is nothing special. Something or someone that has not interacted with the new (observer+quantum) system yet will still hold the system is in a superposition.  A question that remains is how systems \"decide\" which streak or worldline to follow once entangled, and what mechanism is behind entanglement in the first place. This is called the \"measurement problem\".",

    "answer": "There is a misconception about WW1 that it was all trench warfare and mud. It actually wasnt and trench warfare of that scale was rather rare and there was large variety, you could have trench lines and a few kilometers away, you would have soldiers fighting in open and rather pleasant looking fields.  What made WW1 so nasty was that it was a war using old tactics with new weapons. This created a horrible meat grinder. You would have entire armies who had no doctorine to adapt to these new weapons so you could entire companies charging into machine guns because the idea of flanking or a pincher manuever wasnt perfected  WW1 also saw the invention of many nasty weapons. Chemicals were used everywhere and WW1 also saw the invention of the flamethrower and the tank. This was extremely jarring to the common soldier back then who was used to horse carriges and archaic bolt action rifles.  WW2 on the other hand was much more reminiscent of the wars we have today. It was a highly mechanised war where machines did the fighting. There was no time for trenches and frontlines moved rapidly not that it wasnt a horrible war in itself",

Database: a datastore with formally defined operations for creating, requesting, updating and deleting data.  Databases come in a variety of flavors.  Relational database: a database that not only stores data, but also stores the relations of that data.  Data is generally stored in tables with rows and columns.  The columns of the table generally describe the schema, or shape, of the data.  The rows of the table generally represent individual records of the table.  Tables can be linked or related to each other with \"foreign keys\".  For example, an \"Order\" table might have a \"CustomerId\" column which is a foreign key for the \"Customer\" table, which relates the Order and Customer tables together.  This gives you an incredible amount of flexibility in how you can query your data, as you can choose to join the two tables together on the foreign key and filter your data by any column from any of your joined tables.  Nonrelational database: a database that avoids storing relational data.  These are also known as \"NoSQL\" databases.  These databases are generally much faster than relational databases, but come with the downside that querying data is much less flexible.

    "question": "ELI5: In power grids, how fast do individual electrons move?",
    "answer": "It is a great question. The analogy of water flowing in a pipe, sort of breaks down once you get to the level of electrons and such.   1) Electrons are not massless particles. Therefore electrons cannot travel at the speed of light. The explanation is from Einstein: that anything with mass would need infinite energy to accelerate to the speed of light.   2) What is \"moving\" at the speed of light is the change in the electromagnetic field. The term used is propagate rather than move.   3) The speed of individual electrons cannot actually be measured with precision. But the presence of a voltage in wire will induce a \"general flow\" of electrons in one direction. (Imagine water in a turbulent river - we cannot say what speed any particular drop of water is moving but we can tell how fast the entire flow is moving in general) This flow speed is called \"drift velocity\" and is called drift because in most circumstances it is VERY slow.   4) Drift velocity direction depends on which side of the wire has higher voltage relative to the other. In power grids, the voltage is AC, so it swings from positive to negative. In effect the drift velocity switches each time the voltage switches signs and therefore the average drift velocity in the power grid is ZERO. That is, electrons aren't \"shooting out\" at one end of an electric cable.   So one can imagine electrons essentially moving backwards and forwards but not really going anywhere. This is just an illustration - electrons don't organize themselves like balls of stuff and their actual motion isn't like cars going down a road.",

Whether I agree to pay a guy to shovel snow from my driveway, or handle my investment portfolio, I don't expect them to give me freebies outside the terms of the agreement just because.  Where things start to go wrong is when corporations act like their employees are their family, expecting them to do extra things for free just because they're family and that's what family does for each other, right? Except no, because in most cases this generosity is one-way, the employer won't do the employee any favours in return.  All a union really does is enforces the terms of the contract so that the employee cannot be made to suffer just for doing \"only\" what was contractually obligated. They also ensure that the terms of the contract are fair for what is being demanded of the employee.",

    "question": "Eli5: why is there no test for the \u201cchemical imbalance\u201d that is often mentioned for depression?",
    "answer": "If it\u2019s any similar to some other hormones like the HPA axis, it\u2019s because there\u2019s only a very low amount of that chemical circulating in your body at a time. Most of it is produced in your brain and used a very short distance \u2018downstream\u2019 from there, which effectively leads to undetectable amounts in the wider circulation. So if you took a blood sample from someone\u2019s arm like we normally do, you would hardly detect the chemical, let alone be able to tell if there\u2019s an imbalance. You\u2019d have to take a blood sample inside the brain between the two specific points where the chemical is produced and absorbed again, to be able to tell anything at all.  That being said, things like depression or adhd are usually caused by neurotransmitter problems. They are molecules that you find in the brain and that allow one neurone to communicate with the next, but they are not found in blood much at all. So again you\u2019d have to somehow sample the connection between two neurones to measure the amount of neurotransmitter.  An easier way to do it is to monitor the effect of drugs that affect neurotransmitters. If you give them SSRIs (serotonin reuptake inhibitors), what you are doing is forcing serotonin to be present for a longer time before it is reabsorbed, thereby making sure the signal travels correctly from one neurone to the next. Normal people will react differently to the drug compared to depressed people with a serotonin deficiency as it were. Compare it to to adhd meds: normal people on adderall act all high, while people with adhd on adderall are able to calm down",

I have ADHD and, while the cause is relatively well understood, it's extremely difficult to perform physical diagnostics, since the issue takes place between synapses in the brain and is otherwise not detectable in the body. So, instead of literally performing brain surgery to diagnose ADHD, we use data, like everyday experiences, school grades, attention tasks etc to determine whether ADHD is a likely culprit of the person's problems. Once that has been established, it's relatively easy to use Adderall or Ritalin to bolster the diagnosis.  When I first took Adderall (at 30), I expected something new to happen in my brain. I had taken other drugs (alcohol, nicotine, THC, MDMA) before and usually it would add an experience to my brain. So I sat down and waited for something to happen. But nothing did. At some point, I looked over to my SO and she was looking at me weirdly. I asked, \"What's up?\" and she replied, \"I've never seen you sit so still for so long.\". I hadn't even noticed, but I just sat there and waited, without fiddling with anything, without shaking my leg, without looking around in the room. And then I understood that I didn't have to wait for a new experience  to appear, I had to notice which experiences disappeared.  This is mostly different for people who do not suffer from ADHD. While, in ADHD patients, the drug normalizes the dopamine level between synapses, in non ADHD patients, it raises the dopamine level between synapses above normal. Taking too high a dose of Adderall will do the same to ADHD patients.  For someone with ADHD, taking Adderall is like using noise cancelling headphones on a plane \u2013 but for the brain. When you sit on a plane and the noise is constant, you can kind of forget that it's there, but if you turn on noise cancellation, you notice the stark difference. With Adderall it's not quite as sudden, so you don't notice the switch, just as if noise cancellation was turned on gradually over 15 minutes. If that was the case, you would be able to detect noise cancellation by performing tasks that aren't possible without it. Without noise cancellation, watching a movie at 40% volume leads to you not understanding most of the conversations. With noise cancellation, you can easily understand everything at 40%.  These kinds of tasks make it easy to detect whether Adderall is working on you or not. When I read a book without Adderall, I have to re-read every fourth sentence and I start thinking about or doing something else within 15 minutes without even realizing that I actually wanted to read. With Adderall, I sit down and read a book for 2 hours, don't have to re-read sentences and don't look at my phone every 5 minutes.  \"Chemical imbalances\" in the brain can be extremely difficult or nearly impossible to diagnose directly, but it can be quite straight forward to diagnose them through applying a solution to a suspected imbalance and observing whether it causes the intended effects.",

    "question": "ELI5: what do Galois groups actually prove about solvability?",
    "answer": "It is a bit complicated but let me try. First, there's two notions called \"solvability,\" one for polynomials and one for groups (I'll explain what groups are later). They'll turn out to be very intimately related, although it may not look like it from the get go. First let me explain the polynomial side of things, it might be a bit easier to grasp.  Ok, so start with a field (we usually take Q, so if you're not sure what the general definition of a field is, just picture rational numbers). You can ask yourself \"what's the smallest set containing Q and some real number that isn't in Q which has a coherent addition and multiplication such that all the \"nice\" properties hold (distributivity, commutativity, associativity, additive and multiplicative inverses)? For example, what's the smallest \"nice\" set (field) containing Q and sqrt(2)? Well, it turns out the best you can do is take all of Q and add all rational multiples of sqrt(2), so you end up with a set consisting of all rational numbers, all rational multiples of sqrt(2), and all possible sums of those. So, \u00bd is an element. So is 3/4xsqrt(2), and so is 4/435435+ 32/9sqrt(2). More generally, any element can be written as a+bsqrt(2), for a and b rational numbers. That set is written Q\\[sqrt(2)\\] (Q adjoin root 2).   Now, I may want to solve a polynomial like x\\^2 -2. The roots as you know are sqrt 2 and - sqrt 2, so they aren't rational. The smallest extension of the rational numbers in which I can find every single root is (in this case) Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. That means that if I wanted to write that polynomial in factored form, the smallest place I could do it is in Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. We say that this polynomial is \"solvable\" because I can write it in factored form in some extension of Q which I get to by adding roots. (There's nothing special about only adjoining root 2. I could adjoin any nth root of any rational number, and I could do that as many times as I want. So, something like Q\\[sqrt(2), cube root(1252), sqrt(34564)\\] is also a radical extension, and a polynomial which splits into linear factors in that extension would also be solvable).   Now let's turn to group theory. A group is just a set of symmetries of something -- it's all the ways you can reorder a thing and preserve it in some way. For example, the set of reorderings of the numbers (1,2) is a group containing the elements \"do nothing\" and \"switch 1 and 2.\" Certain groups have a property called \"solvability\" which is technical and seemingly unmotivated. Let's treat it as a black box.   Now, Galois theory relates extensions like Q\\[sqrt 2\\] to groups in a very precise way. For each extension, you can find a unique polynomial which factors linearly over that extension \\*and\\* when you combine all the factors, you get a polynomial with coefficients in Q \\*and\\* is as small (low degree) as possible. In the Q\\[sqrt 2\\] example, that polynomial is x\\^2-2 and it's called the minimal polynomial. The Galois group of the extension is the group which swaps all the roots of the minimal polynomial between each other (in a coherent way). For Q\\[sqrt 2\\], the Galois group is the group which can do 2 things: nothing, or swap sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), and leave everything else the same. What that means is that the group \"acts\" on the extension. Say I take the group element g which swaps the roots. Then I can apply that element to a random element a + b sqrt(2) of Q\\[sqrt 2\\]. Then g(a+bsqrt(2)) = a-b sqrt(2), because I switch the roots and leave everything else the same.   If that group has the \"solvable\" property, then that polynomial is \"solvable\". Ie, I can write all of its roots in some extension of Q that I get to only by adding some nth roots. The same thing works in reverse: If I can solve a polynomial only by adding nth roots, then the galois group of that extension is solvable. If one of those conditions fails, then the other one must fail as well.   What Galois showed is that every possible group associated to a field where the degree of the minimal polynomial is less than 5 is solvable, but that some groups bigger than that are not solvable. So that implies that every polynomial of degree < 5 is such that every solution is a radical expression, but not every polynomial of degree >= 5 satisfies that.",
    "follow-up": "That actually makes more sense, thank you!  I'm not sure I understand what separates solvable and unsolvable yet, but I appreciate the response.  So if I understand right, quintics (that aren't raised quartics) are unsolvable by radicals since the linear factorization would have to involve every elementary function to contain all the algebraic permutations, and division/subtraction would very quickly bring you out of the rational/positive fields, making the distributive operations throw out meaningless relations?",

( around 10\\*\\*-12 vs 10\\*\\*-7 meters )  IOW, the wavelength of an electron from an electron microscope is about 100 thousand times smaller.  Smaller wavelengths mean more precise images.  &#x200B;  You can take pictures of living things, but they won't be very healthy afterwards.  They are getting hit by very energetic particles which will kill most living things.  Also, even if the living thing can survive being zapped by a particle beam, it has to hold its breath for a long time.  Electron microscopes need the sample in a vacuum to prevent arcing of the electron gun.  And, on top of all of this, most samples for electron microscopes are sliced into very thin sheets.",

    "question": "ELI5: How does an electron microscope work?",
    "answer": ">I know the machine fires electrons at a sample and the electrons are reflected back.   This is close enough for our purposes.  >How does that translate into a super detailed image?  The important item here is that the level of detail you can resolve depends on the wavelength of what you're bouncing off the target.  You can see finer details if you image in blue light (450nm) than Near IR (2000 nm).  Due to quantum physics being weird, electrons aren't really balls but instead wiggly energy packets that have a wavelength.  There are a bunch of different ways to calculate the wavelength of fundamental particles like electrons but in general its <1nm making it able to show you much much finer detail than light could because it can sneak into nooks and crannies.  If you take a microscope and just keep cranking up the zoom on an optical image, it will get bigger but it will also get blurrier because the little distortions from when the light clipped the edge of the lens and tiny abnormalities of the lenses matter when you're at 1,000,000x zoom.  This is the same reason you can't just zoom wayyyyy in on an 8 inch telescope and see great detail on Pluto, you need a bigger lens and shorter wavelength to let you capture the detail so you can zoom in on it.  Since the electron wavelength is soo much smaller you can zoom in proportionally more before the edge effects matter and blur your image beyond use.  > Why can it only use dead samples?  Because it'd be dead by the time you're sampling it  What happens when you shoot the electron beam?  It smacks into atoms and sends other electrons shooting off to be detected.  If you have air in the chamber that air would catch the electrons before they hit your sample so electron microscopes are all in vacuum chambers and suck all the air out before imaging.  The sample is also generally prepped in a fine layer of carbon or gold to give a nice conductive surface for good imaging.  That wouldn't be particularly great for anything that was alive.  >Also, why is it in black and white?  Because you're better at detecting changes in black/white than in color  All the sensor is getting back is a location on it and how many electrons hit that spot, its effectively only able to judge brightness and can't tell you anything about those electrons.  When you look at a color image its because you want to know the count of how many photons would have triggered your red cones, your green cones, and your blue cones, but if you only have one set of data (photons that hit cones) then grayscale is the right way to represent that  If you need more information about the surface an electron microscope has tools *wayyyy* better than color.  You can put down the little cursor and go \"hey what's this?\" and the system will shoot electrons at it and plot you [the chemical analysis of that spot](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hanan-Youssef-7/publication/272408064/figure/fig3/AS:323999889412099@1454259001358/SEM-and-EDS-chemical-analysis-for-the-Ag-substituted-Ti-Z-A.png) which tells you what its made of and roughly how much of what which is *wayyyyy* better than trying to eyeball the color to tell if its copper or gold",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do some fabrics/materials make you sweat profusely without actually warming you?",
    "answer": "If you sweat then you are warm. So the clothes do keep you warm or the temperature is so high you do not need them. Let ignore the case when you would sweat with no clothes on, getting cold and freezing is not usually a problem in conditions like that.  If you sweat and have clothes on you have a problem. There is water on your skin, to keep dry it needs to move to the surrounding environment. So you need clothes that let the water through. It can be water that wicks out as a liquid from your skin and then evaporate and become a gas, it can also be water the evaporate on your skin. Regardless of how it happens if your water can't escape you will be weat.  So if you have clothes that do not let water through and sweat will stay inside them and are what.    Cloth is not warming you unless they have an active heat source, which is quite uncommon but to exist. What clothes do is reduce the rate hat is transported from your body to the environment. The way is done is primary to have material that traps a lot of air and stops it from moving. Air is a bad conductor of heat so this will keep you warm. Water is a good conductor of heat and will so water-soaked closed will transport heat away from your body and you get cold.  If you keep water from escaping you also keep air from escaping and that will reduce the rate heat is transported from your body.  So they will make you warmer but can make you warm and then you sweat.  So if you sweat profusely the clothes are keeping you warm or more exactly to warm. They might not keep you warm when they are wet but then you have stopped sweating.  One major way to stay warm is to remove clothes when you are active so you do not sweat. If you will do some physical activity that makes you warm remove clothes so you start to feel a bit too cold when stationary. When you then start to move you will get warmer and hopefully, you do not get so hot so you sweat.  It is a mistake to dress for being stationary and then start moving. Regardless of what material your clothes are made of you will sweat and if it can't escape you get colder when you stop. Dress in layers and adjust the clothing to your activity,",

    "answer": "The plankton and algae that die and become deposited on the ocean floor are the source of oil. When many layers of these dead ocean microorganisms pile up in layers, the layers compact on each other due to the weight. This is known as lithifaction. This can make thick layers of concentrated organic matter, especially as it gets buried deep below ground where heat and pressure break down organics into oil. (but not too deep, the earth gets hotter with depth, the oil turns to graphite/carbon if its too deep).  Oil is trapped underground by different types of rocks- Some allow water, oil, and gasses to move through it, like sandstones or shales (along the layers) while other rocks don't allow it to travel through it (perpendicular to the layers in shale), and mudstones. These are called permeable rocks vs impermeable rocks- and they are important in keeping the oil from diluting into other rock layers as something that can't be mined. You have different layers of ocean rock because of seasons and climates. Some seasons and climates favor plankton, others do not. Since over time these change, you have different rock layers.   This doesn't mean that the ocean rock is oil rich, the rock must concentrate the oil some to make it something that can be extracted generally. Oil will have water with it, and water helps dissolve the gasses and volatiles. You have geologic events that create folds in the ground (called anticlines, synclines, domes) that move the oil/gas to concentrated areas where liquid oil can be pumped out of.   &#x200B;  So, in short the plankton is concentrated in the rock, buried deeply with tons of pressure and heat, and then plate tectonics helps concentrate the oil in pockets.  -Geologist in training.",

To understand this, you need to know a little about cognitive bias as a whole.

    "answer": "Or by \"machine learning\", which is just the programmer programming the AI to play the game itself before playing vs human.  Example - I made a hangman game. The \"ai\" can play the game itself but starts with only the alphabet. It takes guesses in sequence, noting a correctly guessed letter each time and the word + word length each time it dies.  By the end of 1000 iterations, it guesses the correct word 70% of the time. It always starts with 'e' as it came up the most times in its previous games.  To make it more efficient, you would add extra 'lists' to be filled and keep track of, like word length x letter used - narrowing down the selection to choose from. You can then go further - after every successful guess, search your word list for matching words. And so forth.   In the end, it is just the program storing information in different ways that is then used.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why does only one side of your nose get stuffed when sick?",
    "answer": "Your sinuses (what your nostrils feed into and then into your trachea and lungs) isn't one big cavity. [It's actually 4 different chambers](https://breathefreely.com/pasha-chamber-of-sinuses/) (2 for each nostril) for the majority of the population (there's an estimated 10% of the population that have 6 sinus chambers/3 per nostril).  So the short and simple of it is that any of the 4 chambers could be inflamed at any given time causing the 'stuffy nose' symptom in one or both nostrils. But, your body is pretty good about making sure you keep breathing (unless you have sleep apnea) so it regulates the erectile tissue in each side of your sinus to usually make sure you can breath out of one of them.   To get a little deeper into it, the process of warming and humidifying the air you're breathing into your lungs through your nose is energy and resource intensive so your body only sends the extra blood to one nostril at a time. But this extra blood causes the tissue to swell (kind of like when you injure your skin and the area around it swells because of the increased blood flow to the injury) and when you're sick you already have increased blood flow to the infection in your sinuses and this increases the stuffiness on the side your body is trying to regulate the air quality in. Here's a good read about it with the science to back it up: https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19535169/nasal-cycle/",
    "follow-up": "What about when you're not sick, and there's no infection?

    "answer": "The ideal antenna for one particular wavelength and beam direction is relatively easy to figure out...it's a stick of the right length and right orientation relative to the beam. The challenge is usually that nobody wants infinite sticks, you often don't have room for a stick of the right length, and you don't know what direction the wave is coming from.  If you know that it's all going to come at you mostly in a flat plane, but you don't know what direction, a pole is fine. See: basically every car antenna of the 1900s or all early cell phones. If you can steer the antenna to point at the source that's also fine (see: all those dishes on satellites and ships and news vans...not the dish itself, that's just a \"radio mirror\", but you can steer the actual antenna.   After that, it's all compromises that make the antenna worse at actually picking things up but potentially better at fitting into where you want it. If you can make it bigger enough to overcome the performance degradation enough to come out ahead on shape, you're OK. This is how you can embed antennas in the window glass of your car now, or in the flat panel of your computer, or the edge or back of your phone.   The ideal antenna length scales with wavelength...as we've gone to higher and higher frequencies (smaller wavelengths) antennas also got way smaller.",

Many colleges/universities even require Freshmen to live on campus for the first year at least, so that drastically increases how much money a person actually spends \"on\" education.   There *is* financial aid for students in the form of student loans, grants and especially scholarships. There are scholarships for literally everything you can imagine. Some are offered by social organizations, some are offered by churches, some are offered by alumni groups, etc.. I've literally seen automobile mechanic shops offering scholarships - the requirement was writing a short essay about what it takes to maintain a car and why some people pride themselves on taking care of their car -_-.   Some states *are* moving towards tuition-free campuses for *in-state* students (for instance, you live in the state and completed high school there). Sometimes this covers tuition up to a certain amount in community colleges, sometimes it's grants to study at public universities.   The only real downside to the government subsidizing education more at this level would be an increase in taxes, and a lot of people are opposed to that, since they ... don't think it's fair (\"I had to pay to go to college, now I have to pay for someone else to go?\"), they think they will be taxed more (even if they are in a tax bracket where they probably *wouldn't* be taxed more), they don't see the benefit because their immediate family isn't going to attend college, etc.",

Primary brain tumors are far more prevalent in children because their brains are still developing AND this is where you're more likely to see bad genetic conditions that predispose people to cancer presenting with primary brain cancer (not always but generally).  The biggest thing with development of cancer is that something happens that damages DNA and your body can't repair the damage. In cells that rapidly replicate, this is like setting the train of the tracks as with more dividing, the cells gradually accumulate more mutations.

I can then sell the painting for $100,000, and I've just converted $90,000 of cash I can't explain into $100,000 that looks legitimate.  Art sales can also be entirely in cash and 100% anonymous.

    "answer": "Hoo boy. That is a simple question with a very complex answer. To understand why you need to understand torque and angular momentum in spinning bodies.  So the basics you need to know is we measure the force of something spinning by its angular momentum. This force is a tangent to the circle or a straight line only intersecting the spin at one point. You can visualize this by spinning something on the end of a string then letting it go. That object on a string will fly off in one direction. That direction is the direction of the force being applied at that moment. Which indicates to you the direction of it's angular momentum.  Now we go to torque. To make something spin it needs to be fixed to a singular point. There must be an axis which it spins around and resists that straight line force we call angular momentum. Otherwise the spin would just turn to linear force. As we know from physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So as the axis pulls against the object, so to must the object pull against the axis. That pull on the axis is what we call a torque. The direction of that torque force is defined with a right hand rule. If you point your right hand and curl your fingers in the direction of the spin and stick your thumb out, the direction of your thumb is the direction of the torque force. Notice your thumb is now pointing perpendicular to the spin.   (A YouTube video to explain it in depth https://youtu.be/mRZGdvJQnPU)  Now we tie that back into your car. So all 4 wheels on your car are spinning. As we just established that means they have angular momentum and torque. Fortunately for you the torque is normally not enough to overcome the friction between your tires and the road. So you never feel that torque. However, when you hit a deep enough puddle, all that friction is removed and the perpendicular torque force of your car easily can pull you sideways.",
    "follow-up": "Not trying to be a dick, genuinely trying to offer constructive criticism:  Instead of the rather long explanation, could you not have simply said something along the lines of \"When your tires hit water, they lose friction/traction and the force of the now freely spinning wheel could be enough to pull your car off its current line\"?

It\u2019s lifelong and requires both insulin supplementation as well as dietary interventions.  It cannot be cured.    Type 2 is an acquired failure of the body to properly use the insulin it produces.  One theory widely accepted now is that the receptor sites  for insulin get \u201cburned out\u201d from over use.  The standard diet of processed refined carbohydrates plus modified fats is particularly hard on the body.  It may have a genetic predisposition that gets triggered by diet.   Type 2 can be reversed through diet and exercise.  But will come back if not rigorously maintained.",

Most often, that damage means the cell won't be able to survive and perform its function and the cell dies (or is killed by the immune system) without causing any harm.  Sometimes, the DNA damage causes the cell to survive, grow, and reproduce uncontrollably, potentially spreading to other areas of the body.  At this point, the cells are considered cancerous and can grow and multiply to form tumors, ignore signals to stop growing, redirect bloodflow from the body to keep themselves growing, 'hide' from the immune system by appearing to be healthy, and potentially move into new areas of the body.  The damage to the DNA can come from any number of sources, from a simple mistake in making a copy to direct damage from UV radiation to carcinogenic chemicals that enter the cell and cause damage.",

You can however still feel hungry in this case depending on what you eat.  The other feeling is feeling satiated (not hungry). In order to feel this you need to eat enough food to fill your stomach to a certain degree but also eat enough nutrients. In particular you need to eat enough protein and certain fats.  These nutrients are needed by your body and there are special nerve receptors that won't stop sending the \"I am hungry\" signal until enough nutrients have been consumed.  Depending on what you eat you will also stay satiated for a longer time as certain combinations of food will inhibit the bodys ability to digest and make use of the nutrients.  For example if you eat 4 eggs for breakfast you will feel satiated longer than if you eat 4 eggs and a piece of white bread.

    "answer": "RAM access takes time, because it's far away on the timescales of CPU computation.   Typically, when the CPU needs to read a value stored in RAM, it will need to wait 100 to 400 cycles for it to arrive. When you consider that a CPU is supposed to make (approximately) one operation each cycle, waiting for a hundred ones while doing nothing is a massive problem for performance.  That's what the cache is for. It provides a much smaller space to store things, but with much faster access (1 to 20 cycles depending on the cache). Cache is part of the CPU chip so is much more expensive than RAM for the same memory, but is much faster to access.  As a result, the CPU stores the currently uses data in the cache to speed up operations. Any time it needs a value not in the cache, it will request its value from the ram, and will keep it in the cache in case it needs it again.  Once the CPU runs out of cache space, it will take the oldest values in the cache (the ones it hasn't accessed for a long time), and will write them back in RAM, making space for other values.  As a result, the more cache you have, the more data you can keep close to your CPU, and the less you have to perform longer RAM access operations.",

That split has gotten bloody in Europe on a number of occasions (e.g. the Hundred Years' War), for the same reason that e.g. Sunni vs Shia Muslims is a common axis of conflict in the Middle East.

    "answer": "The medication just breaks down and is less effective.  The FDA requires all medications to have an expiration date of no later than two years after the date of manufacture, regardless of how long the medicine actually stays good.  Many medications stay effective long after that, its mostly just a matter of trying it and seeing if it still works.  You just don't want to take more than whatever the normal dose is, even if it seems less effective, since some medications have a very low margin of safety and so taking 3 pills that are 75% effective as opposed to 2 that are 100% might put you over that, for example.  The FDA requires expired medications to be safe if you are taking no more than the maximum dose of them.  IE, if a medication says to take 2 pills it will *always* be safe to take 2 pills regardless of how expired the medication is.  Again, the worst thing that happens is it just does nothing.  There are a handful of exceptions to this, all of which are drugs used to treat very rare conditions and which come with a prominent warning that they can become poisonous as they age.",

    "answer": "One act can result in several charges.  In fact, killing a person usually triggers a dozen other crimes (for example, illegal use of weapon, assault, endangerment, etc.). The standard practice in America and many other countries is to build enough record to cover all of them, and then go to trial with the most important ones (you usually don't see \"murder and jaywalking\" go to trial, because the jaywalking isn't important enough).  The jury's job is to convict on ALL the crimes that are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and not worry about the duplications.  Then, the judge's job is to use that stack to calculate the sentence.  Sentencing laws are complicated, but generally, this is where the principle that your can't be convicted twice for the same crime kicks in. The sentence will mainly come down to the greatest of the offenses, and all the lesser crimes that came along for the ride, but weren't really independent actions, will be considered aggravating factors rather than separate crimes.   P.S. I should add that one reason this is useful is that it's quite common for a jury to find that the most severe felony charge was not proven, but that the lesser charges were proven. For instance if the jury find the accused did indeed kill the victim, but the jury decides it was unintentional, then they don't get convicted of intentional homicide, but that lesser stack of guilty convictions for things like manslaughter and assault will kick in.",

    "answer": "X-ray scans are purely to show density - less dense (and water rich) tissues are relatively transparent, whereas mineral and metal rich areas are more dense, hence have a higher ability to attenuate (block over a short distance) X-rays. That\u2019s how the imaging works to detect abnormalities in the body.  You\u2019d need chemical testing to figure out what the filling is made from. Amalgams are mercury based alloys, but the thing about heavy metal toxicity is that they need to be in a water soluble form (such as nitrate or chloride salts, through reaction with their acids) to actually be able to get into the body where they cause neurological issues. As a metal, mercury poses little threat when confined as a solid alloy, as it isn\u2019t susceptible to chemical reactions in the oral environment. Mercury when usually handled isn\u2019t even dangerous through the skin, but it can be as it gives off vapours which are toxic when inhaled, so prolonged exposure of course isn\u2019t recommended.  When used in dentistry amalgams, the mercury is generally combined with silver, copper, or tin.  Also, amalgams are generally a grey-silvery metal, so that\u2019s how you can easily tell as a rule of thumb.

    "question": "ELI5: How is electricity physically measured (like at the meter on my house)?",
    "answer": "Maybe not ELI5, but here you go.  Electricity is the flow of electrons.   Electrons flow because they are pushed by a *voltage*. The voltage is like the pressure causes water to flow in a pipe.  The amount of electrons that flow is termed the *current*. The current is like the flowrate of water in the pipe.  More voltage (pressure) = more current (flow).  So if you want to talk about flow, you might say there are 10 electrons travelling past a point every second (electrons per second), just like how you might talk about water flow in litres or gallons per second.  If you want to find the total volume of water, you take the flow and multiply it by time. So if you had 10 litres per second, after 100 seconds you used 10\u00d7100=1000 litres.  Same for electricity. You take the amperage, and multiply it by time. We could do electrons per second, but we use Amperes to measure current. We also use hours instead of seconds.  So what do you get when you multiply Amperes and Hours? Ampere-hour (Ah), which is what you see on your electricity bill. The ampere-hour is the amount of electricity you used.  Now we know how you measure time, but what about current?  Inside your meter is a *current transformer*. This consists of a metal donut that surrounds the main conductor going into your house. A copper wire is coiled around the donut.  The electricity going through the main conductor is AC (*alternating current*). Now when electricity flows, it creates a magnetic field. When that current *alternates*, so does the magnetic field. So you have an *alternating magnetic field* surrounding the main conductor. This fluctuating magnetic field causes magnetic field lines to pass through that copper coil in your little current transformer, and that *induces* a small current in the copper coil.  This copper coil is connected to a smarter device which includes an ammeter which measures the current. This is then used to calculate the current in the main conductor.  The current \u00d7 time calculation is done at small intervals and added together to account for varying loads.",

    "answer": "Back in the 2017 crypto bull run, bitcoin was really expensive to send around because of the network congestion but sending eth around was super cheap. Since eth allows you to do smart contracts, you can make an eth token called \u201cbitcoin\u201d (or \u201cwrapped bitcoin\u201d so it doesn\u2019t confuse people), and essentially lock up an actual bitcoin in a ethereum smart contract and send around that eth token (called eth wrapped bitcoin) instead.   The real bitcoin is still there, gaining or losing value, but you can send around your eth token and pay minimal eth fees instead of sending around that actual bitcoin.  Fast forward to this bull run and people made jokes how it should be bitocin wrapped eth now (since eth fees got pretty ridiculous). This can\u2019t happen quite yet because bitcoin can\u2019t do smart contracts.  It\u2019s basically a bridge between chains. So you can use any coin on any network.  Edit:  I\u2019m going to add to this because I\u2019m obsessed with crypto and want everyone else to be as well.   You may see tokens like cETH, aUSDC, or CAKE-LP (as opposed to the actual assets: ETH, USDC, or CAKE). These are called proof of ownership tokens. You can look at them like receipts.   For example, let\u2019s say I have some USDC (US dollar coin), and I want to get interest on my USDC. To do this, I deposit them into a lending pool (let\u2019s say I use the Aave protocol). Once they leave my wallet, I get aUSDC (Aave USDC) in return. This is an absolutely amazing and overlooked feature of crypto. This aUSDC I have is just as valuable as the asset itself + any interest it\u2019s generating. If I sent you my aUSDC tokens, you can withdraw all my usdc (and any accrued interest) out of Aave. This allows the usdc holder to not only gain interest in the Aave lending pool but now take that \u201creceipt\u201d and use that value somewhere else to generate even more passive income.   Uhhhg I could go on but then I\u2019ll for sure be treading on waters that are too difficult for 5 year olds if I haven\u2019t already >.<  Dm me if you have any questions! Always happy to explain more :D",
    "follow-up": "Since you're a crypto enthusiast, could you explain the reasoning behind it? From an economics point of view crypto is at best a store of value (assuming it's relatively predictable).   I think my econ prof explained it best with the gold coins vs silver coins example. When there were gold coins and silver coins, people would hoard the gold, and spend the silver. This was because silver was relatively abundant and more was entering the supply each day. As a result of the influx, silver devalued while gold didn't. Applying this to crypto, we have fiat currency and crypto, even assuming that crypto tames volatility, it's still just another gold, except you can argue that gold has intrinsic value from being useful, whereas crypto is just a thing that exists.  I don't see what crypto is supposed to do, it's advertised strengths are, security of value, and freedom of capital.  However, store of value only works when there is relative stability, which there isn't. And even if there were, it still holds no advantages over gold. Additionally, transitioning to a crypto based currency system would mean national governments lose the ability to pursue expansionary fiscal (and monrtary) policy, resulting in every economic downturn hitting like it was 1929. The freedom of capital is also dubious since, the blockchain is made up mainly of large operations as opposed to the grassroots vision of people with their GPUs. If crypto were a mainstream commerce tool beyond a speculative thing, it would once again be dominated by institutional players like banks, and with a digital medium they can probably pull as yet unthought of schemes.",

The answer is that, except in special cases, walls do not support anything (but their own weight), but columns do. This is why when you see a building being constructed, you see the frame (beams and columns) being built first, and then walls built later. This is why you sometimes see beams sticking out from the sides of the roof. In this case, we say that walls (called curtain walls) are not an active structural element: they do not contribute to the supporting frame. They're there like curtains: because nobody likes to live in a room with no walls (but they're also helpful in avoiding certain complex loads).  Slabs that make the floor are typically supported by the horizontal beams on the side (and sometimes columns when they're huge). Beams are supported by columns around the corners, and they're sometimes hidden. Columns are supported by the frame from the lower level, and so on..all the way to the foundations.

    "question": "ELI5: If the purpose of cooking meat is to kill bacteria, how come it's still not safe to cook and eat once it's off?",
    "answer": "Actually, sometimes we *do* cook and eat old meat. We refer to it as \u201caged.\u201d  It\u2019s commonly done with game, like venison, by hanging the meat where it\u2019s cool, after gutting and skinning the carcass. Aged beef is a delicacy in some places. Cooking kills bacteria, as you said, and denatures proteins, as another commenter wrote.  The toxins produced by the bacteria are proteins, and are thus destroyed by cooking. If you\u2019ve ever seen advice to \u201cheat to boiling for twenty minutes\u201d to make water safe or to ensure that home-canned foods are safe (from botulism), the purpose of the heat/time is to allow the toxins to be denatured, rendering them harmless.   For most foods, however, the distinction must be made between \u201caged\u201d and \u201cspoiled\u201d (or \u201crotten\u201d).     Next time you see some fungus on a fruit or veggie, look closely. The fluffy stuff is just the reproductive portion. The bulk of a fungus, the mycelia, isn\u2019t that part, but is inside the apple or green pepper or cantaloupe. If you examine it, you\u2019ll see that the infected area is distinctly different, usually mushy, from being digested by the mycelia. That part would not be palatable, even if you cooked it. So we toss it out. But you can quite often simply scoop out or cut out the entire mycelial body and and safely eat the remainder.   With bacteria, especially on meat, it\u2019s more insidious. Bacteria move throughout the meat, following natural channels like arterioles, capillaries, lymph vessels, even nerve tracts. The toxins they release are not toxins to them \u2013 some toxins are actually digestive enzymes. Bacteria don\u2019t have oral openings; bacteria must absorb predigested food through their membrane. So the best toxins move throughout the meat or milk or yogurt or living body (think strep). Not only do they make it very dangerous to eat it raw, even handling it might expose you to dangerous toxins.  Can you still eat it after thorough cooking?  Maybe, but it would be very risky if even a little of it is undercooked, and quite likely it will be unpalatable either way.   As an aside, the fact that carnivores and scavengers *can* safely eat rotten meat is one line of evidence that humans did not evolve as meat eaters. Not only do we not have the dentition nor claws/talons to kill much, we don\u2019t have enzymes and sufficiently acidic gastric fluids to handle even slightly rotted meats. Humans probably evolved as opportunistic meat eaters, eating small, easy to catch animals like caterpillars, lizards, mussels/clams, crayfish, locusts, etc. Fire and tools changed everything.   If someone wants to argue that chimps catch and eat monkeys, I would like to remind you that chimps are stronger, more agile, and have fangs (canines which extend past the surrounding teeth and which can pierce the skin of their prey).  If you think you could catch, say, a rabbit, kill it and then somehow manage to eat it *without any tools whatsoever, no trap, no knives*, I\u2019d be very interested to learn your technique.   It\u2019s also worth pointing out that chimps are *not* our ancestors. They are cousins, descendants of a common ancestor. They have changed over those 6 million years, as have we. They have had 6 million years to become what they are, and we have had the same time to become what we are.",
    "follow-up": ">we don\u2019t have enzymes and sufficiently acidic gastric fluids to handle even slightly rotted meats.  Actually humans _do_ have highly acidic stomachs, with a pH of 1.5.  Our stomach acid levels look more like those of facultative scavengers than of omnivores and probably does protect against foodborn pathogens to some extent.  Exactly _why_ this is the case is a bit of a mystery given that observed human diets aren't usually carrion, but maybe people scavenged more in the past? Maybe it's an adaptation for eating carrion that predates fire?  Or maybe it helps deal with waterborne illness?    Here's a paper on it, the best information is in table 1 (ignore figure 1, which has human on the label but actually shows the average for all omnivores)  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4519257/  Frustratingly, it seems like almost nobody has measured stomach acid in other apes, which would be incredibly important in showing if this is just some ape thing (And shared with other apes which are clearly mostly herbivorous omnivores) or a unique adaptation of humans.  This paper, which discusses human microbiome, dug up one single measurement of chimp stomach acid at pH 7, but that was a captive chimp fed an unrepresentative diet and we really have no idea if the measurement is representative or not.  https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2020.00025/full?utm_source=fweb&utm_medium=nblog&utm_campaign=ba-sci-fevo-early-hominin-microbiome  >If you think you could catch, say, a rabbit, kill it and then somehow manage to eat it without any tools whatsoever, no trap, no knives, I\u2019d be very interested to learn your technique  I don't think that's quite fair.  Using tools is as fundamental a part of being human as any other trait of our species, and goes back a couple million years or so.  Challenging someone to catch and process a rabbit without a sharp rock is like challenging a wolf to catch one without teeth...the tool's as fundamental a part of us as the dentition is to them.",

    "answer": "You're asking different questions here.  About light: it's not like we can expand and contract *that* quickly. When being exposed to high concentrations of light super quickly (ie: looking directly at the sun), the pupils can contract fast, but a faster reaction will occur: you'll close your eyes and look away.   When going from light to darkness, such a \"emergency situation\" doesn't happen, so your eyeballs are alone on that expanding and receiving the new information. It's also crucial to say that we sacrificed nightvision for clear 3D space awareness. Compared to cats or aye-ayes, we're plain bad at seeing in the dark.  About colours: it's not like we identify colours in an instant. It's the brain the one who sees, the eye just gather information.

Compared to nocturnal predators, we're not as good at low light vision, but you don't have to lose it to gain sterioscopic vision, it's not a trade off.

If you have small pupils (around 4mm) than even at full expansion it'll take less than a second to contact and adjust to bright lights.   >For instance, our eyes are physically able to see colour blue, but our minds weren't ready to do until we began experimenting with that colour millennia ago.

    "answer": "A game world starts as an empty three-dimensional space, probably not unlike what our universe would look like if it did not have stars or other matter. The terrain is added and becomes a \"planet\" floating in this three-dimensional empty space.  Usually, the point at which terrain construction begins is an arbitrarily chosen XYZ coordinate. If the empty space was a finite box, then certainly the developer could begin building at the \"floor\" of the box so that if you fell off the terrain, you would \"stand on\" the surface of the box beneath it.  There are a couple reasons why this might not necessarily be the case, though. First, they chose a point way high up on the Z axis just in case they needed to build down. Second, the box is actually a loop, so when you reach one edge, you get teleported to the opposite edge.  It is also possible that the empty space has undefined boundaries. It is literally infinite and the game procedurally moves the edge as you keep falling toward it. Also, it may even be the case that you actually *did* reach the edge and it only *appears* that your character is falling because the game doesn't detect any terrain underneath your character, so the game keeps playing the falling animation because it thinks you are still falling.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why does donating blood make me feel very hot and sweaty?",
    "answer": "What you are describing is some of the first symptoms of shock due to a too low blood pressure. This is normal as you have just donated blood. In addition you should also have an elevated but weaker then normal pulse, a bit of a thirst and cold dry skin. They make sure you do not get low enough blood pressure that you will struggle with these symptoms or even feel much of it but there is a reason you are given the option of the recovery table and given cookies and something to drink.  The feeling of being hot and sweating due to low blood pressure is likely an unintended neurological quirk. What the body is trying to do is to make sure the remaining blood you have stays in the core of the body where it is most needed instead of going close to your skin and into your extremities. But this is normally something which is done to regulate body heat. So as the control of the blood flow is suddenly changed from maintaining temperature to increasing your blood pressure you start to lose control over the core temperature and it triggers other ways of cooling down such as generating the feeling of being hot and sweating.  But this does not quite explain it as one of the more serious symptoms of shock is actually reduced body temperature. So the sweating and feeling of being hot is actually going to work too well over time. This does mean that there is a more serious interaction with the different neural functions in the brain which is not fully understood.  Do not be afraid of telling the nurses about your symptoms. They are in a much better position then you to understand what levels of blood loss are actually dangerous. If they are worried they do have instruments they can hook up to you in order to get your blood pressure and pulse to check if your blood pressure have gone too far down. They can also do a few tests such as your blood sugar and hemoglobin content, something they probably did before you donated as well. Using this they can delay your next visit to help you build more blood volume, give you minerals to help combat deficiencies which again can help you build more blood for next time or reduce the amount of blood you donate. If they see that the situation is critical they can have a doctor look at you and then give you back some fluids directly or even give you back your own blood that you just donated.",

I always grab a water before I get on the table, and I'll usually tell them that I have a tendency of getting hot.   They do check my iron levels before I donate. There's two different places I can donate through. There's the Red Cross and another blood bank that's more local. They measure the levels differently, or some such thing. The Red Cross wants my iron to be around 13 something. The other place is some other measurement that's supposed to be in the 30's? I take iron every day to make sure I have enough.

Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.  When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).  Now, all of this goes fucking nuts when you load a bad set of train cars at Point A. The track sensors located everywhere along the track, detect this alien set of cars and sends a distress call to the Supervisor (your brain). The Supervisor wants to handle the situation without having to phone the Manager (your consciousness) about the craziness on the tracks and also wants to make sure you never know it was on the tracks. It has to make a choice now: send it back to Point A violently and somewhat painfully risking tearing the tracks, or send it to Point B as fast as fuck? Depending on where it's located on the track, it'll choose the best route.  Let's use the destination Point B. The Supervisor hits the panic button and puts all the train cars that are on the track (in your body) on overdrive. The tunnels are flooded with water and lubricant to speed all the cars up and get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Cars collide with each other, and previously well formed cars are just flooded with water and lubricant that they are just a soggy, shadowy reminder of their former glory state.  The Media (pain) hears about the car collisions immediately begins filming live the high speed, flooded train cars out of control. They want to knos how an alien set of train cars were put on the tracks and they want someone to pay for such carelessness. The Manager is just watching the horror unfold on Live TV but cannot do anything to stop it, because the Supervisor was deaf and he had not installed a means of communicating with him after hours in the office.

    "question": "[Eli5] What is the CIELAB color space and how it is used to determine the quality of a surface?",
    "answer": "I think it is best to start this with some history of color spaces. There are many different types of color spaces and they kind of follow each other.  Human vision (in bright light) is handled by three types of cone cells. Each type of cone cell responds to different wavelengths. Lets call the m L-, M- and S-cones (long, medium and short wavelengths).  The most basic idea for measuring color is to measure how much a color exites each different types of cone cells. One could assume that \"pure\" green would only be seen by M-cones, \"pure\" blue only by S-cones and \"pure\" red only by L-cones. However this is not the case. In reality the cone sensitivities overlap so many different cone cells can see the same wavelength. But that is not a problem really. It can be solved by using some math (results in \"negative\" colors appearing in calculations).  In 1931 the CIE 1931 RGB color space was made. They used monochromatic red (700 nm), green (546.1 nm) and blue (435.8 nm) light.   It is a simple color space. For example the coordinate CIERGB (0.5, 0.25, 0.25) would be the color that you get by mixing 50% red, 25% green and 25% blue light.  But CIERGB is not very practical color space. For example the problem about all cones being somewhat sensitive to all wavelengths mean that some colors would have \"negative\" amount of red light in them (i.e. you can't make those colors by mixing red, green and blue). So almost immediately a new color space, CIE 1931 XYZ, was made. It basically the same CIERGB but some simple math is used to make the coordinates always positive. This one is still regularly used in modern physics.  CIEXYZ is nice and simple to use in calculations but it is not perceptual color space. Meaning the values from it are not directly comparable to how things look. For example if you calculate the distance between two colors in CIEXYZ it doesn't really ell anything on how different those colors are.   Also the color primaries it uses are not real colors. The color coordinate CIEXYZ (0.5, 0.25, 0.25) would be the color you get by mixing 50% X, 25% Y and 25% Z colored light. But the X and Z aren't really real colors that you can make and Y is in fact the brightness. But they do make math easy so if you don't care about perceptuality they work just fine.  The next color space is CIELAB (also known as L\\*a\\*b\\*)   It is just CIEXYZ that has gone through some more math to be perceptual and take illumination into account. L\\* is the luminosity and tells how bright the light is while a\\* and b\\* are chromaticity and tell the chromaticity of the light.   Now that it has gone though math to be perceptual you can directly apply its values to human vision.   For example you can calculate the distance between two colors and the resulting number will tell how different those colors are (just normal cartesian distance).",

They can coat your dryers moisture sensor overtime making it less efficient.  You should periodically wipe them down if you use dryer sheets.  This can make the dryer shut off before the clothes are dry or make the dryer run longer than it needs to.  They also coat the fibers on anything that should be wicking such as workout gear, towels, and sheets and make them less absorbent.

    "answer": "In the comments, you're asking a different question. It's not nice to ask a question, then follow up comments with the real question. It wastes time. What you're really asking is something like:  \"If COVID is spreading, how come the flu is not?\"  The first answer is that this year, due to COVID, people are more afraid of the flu than usual. So more people got flu vaccinations than usual. So the flu is at a disadvantage compared to COVID because people are already prepared for it.  The rest involves thinking about how a disease spreads and some fairly complicated science involving how infections spread. While we understand a lot about how most flu viruses spread, COVID is still relatively new and we haven't answered all of the questions for it yet.  These are the reasons I see a lot of articles choosing to answer this question, keeping in mind that there are a lot of different flu viruses and thus some don't follow these rules:  * Most people already have some flu antibodies, so if the flu viruses in the wild this season are similar to previous seasons, we're already at some percentage of natural immunity. * COVID is already infecting many people, where other flu viruses had to start from zero. COVID started infecting us before we were prepared for it, and now that we're trying to take precautions against COVID it's hard for a new virus to get a foothold. * We think COVID \"fits\" in smaller saliva particles and stays \"alive\" in them longer than many flu viruses. That makes it easier to catch COVID than a normal flu.  * We are testing, but haven't concluded, that you can get sick from inhaling fewer COVID virus particles than many other flu viruses. Think of this like people getting drunk: some kinds of liquor will make a person drunk from a shot or two, but people can drink pints of others. * COVID has an above-average time between when you are contagious and when you present symptoms when compared to other flu viruses. That means people sick with COVID find out later and can infect more people before they isolate.   All in all, the answer is just \"COVID is more contagious\" combined with \"it's already here\". We think if we put a contagious person next to 10 healthy people, the 10 healthy people are more likely to get COVID than the average flu virus. So if a mask has something like a 60% rate of protection, but the normal flu has a lower rate of infection to begin with, it follows that the mask is even better at preventing the normal flu than COVID.  The important thing to learn is: we could make EVERY flu season this way if we'd wear masks and try not to stay too close together in flu season.",

    "answer": "It really depends upon the organism being bacteria or virus.  Nobody knows how long Covid-19 vaccines will offer immunity, yet.  Also different vaccines will vary.  Chicken Pox vaccine (varicella) lasts \\~40-50 years, then immunity lessens, that's why there is a Shingles vaccine for elders.  Measles last your lifetime.  Tetanus should be re-vaccinated every 6-10 years.  The yearly flu (influenza) lasts only about a year, but not because the immune system weakens, it's because the virus changes and the body no longer recognizes it.  Vaccines or the natural infection itself (such as chicken pox) give the same immunity.  With chicken pox whose immunity lasts about 40 years, it is the immune system getting weaker.  With influenza, it's \"I don't recognize this enemy.\"  With Tetanus it's \"I forgot how to fight this.\"  Not all mutations are bad.  Back around 2009 the \"swine flu\" hit the world, another pandemic, but the virus mutated so much that it pretty much was no longer a big issue.  Unfortunately Covid-19 is not being so polite, but it also could mutate into a friendlier form, or as you've heard a \"worse\" one.  In this case it's not more harmful, it simply spreads easier.  Covid-19 vaccines are most likely going to become an annual thing, maybe even mixed with the flu shot.  Remember though that vaccines can give \"partial immunity.\"  This means that while you might become ill, you might not become seriously ill.",

    "answer": "It might help to look at what our own instincts \"feel\" like. For example, how do you know to eat food and not to eat mud? It's probably a universal thing for people to try eating dirt, mud, etc. as a child, but outside of a few cases, this is something you do not make a habit of. Things like the flavour tell us mud is bad. Why is it bad? Because it tastes bad. Why is food good? Because it tastes good (at least most of it, some can be hit or miss).   But flavour isn't an inherent quality of materials. It's purely in our minds, caused by taste receptors on our tongue reacting to certain molecules. The tastes considered \"good\" are tied to the presence of certain molecules, and vice versa for bad. The end result is that we \"know\" to eat food without specifically having to be taught.   This connects to genes because the instructions for how to make taste receptors are encoded in DNA. Variations in the exact shape result in different preferences, such as the same food tasting pretty good to one person, but terribly bitter to another.  >How does it get encoded into dna, passed down, and executed.  You're thinking of it backwards. Things didn't start \"outside\" the DNA and then get encoded into it. Things start as DNA and then the DNA makes us, who do things.

I broke my humerus playing roller derby a few years back and the fracture severed my radial nerve, meaning I lost the ability to lift my wrist and extend my fingers.   As other posters have noted your nerves are protected by a myelin sheath, which is basically a tube around the actual nerve. If you think about your cell phone charging cable the nerve is like the metal wire inside that carries the electrical current and the myelin sheath is like the materials covering and insulating it.  When a nerve is damaged the entire portion of the nerve from the point of damage to the termination (or \u201cend\u201d) dies as well. As long as the myelin sheath remains intact or heals properly the nerve will begin to regrow from the point of damage to the termination point.   So when performing a transplant or reconstructive surgery all the surgeons can do is connect these tubes and wait for the nerve to regenerate within.   Nerves grow very slowly, about 1 inch per month. The radial nerve which I severed in my accident invenerates the hand muscles at the top of your forearm. There was approximately six inches between this point and the damage site so it took about six months to fully regain control of my hand functions.   As far as I know this only applies to nerves branching off the spinal column. The spinal nerve itself will not regenerate or heal itself in most circumstances, which is why spinal injuries usually result in permanent disabilities.   But long story short, we can\u2019t directly correct the nervous system through surgery or other intervention, we can only manipulate the tubes in which the nerves reside and wait for the nerves to repair themselves.",

I used to be a console gamer, and I am right handed, and my left thumb can move in circular motions much more delicately and gracefully when moving fast, simulating playing a floating pretend controller. The faster I go, the more jagged, abrupt, and encumbered I notice and feel in my right thumb, even if I'm right handed.  This is to say there's a split between how much you use the limb and how accurately you can convey it. I would be insanely curious if this is your dominant hand and if you regained 95% of it's full function in a year or a year and a half after the injury and the nerve fully regrew.

    "answer": "The answer to this has changed over time, and so has the degree of difference: a late 360 game still looks better than an early 360 game, but not to remotely the same degree that a late NES game looks better than an early NES game.  To some extent, it really is a matter of developers learning to use the hardware more effectively. This is a process that never really stops, and it leads to incremental improvement over time, to a limited degree.  But you mentioned how Sony and Microsoft released hardware upgrades for the PS4 and XBone, and this leads to the other big reason: hardware upgrades to a cobsole's capabilities are not as new as many people think. The main difference is that with disc and digital consoles, these upgrades generally require you to buy a new console or at least swap out bits of the hardware: you can't put more RAM on a disc or download a better video processor.  But on the older cartridge-based systems, hardware upgrades were often built into the games themselves. The NES is especially notorious for its proliferation of different kinds of upgrade chips. Nintendo called most of its upgrades Memory Management Controllers (MMCs), but in a more general sense people call them mappers now. There were limits to what a mapper could do -an NES is still an NES- but these were used to enhance memory, add features like split-screen and larger sprites, and on the Famicom it was even possible to enhance the games' sound (this last didn't work on the NES because of some foolish early decisions on NOA's part). The SNES had its own mappers, as did the Game Boy and the Genesis, but nothing else ever took them to the degree that the NES did.",

Next, imagine stepping on the trampoline.  All the marbles roll to your feet because the trampoline is warped downwards by your foot.    That\u2019s how it works, except large masses actually warp space and time itself, not a trampoline.    Level 2 answer:  All objects are moving through time at the speed of light.  Large masses slow down time - with a decreasing impact the further from the object you are.    So - if I am moving through time at the speed of light and the side of my body that is closest to the earth is moving through time at a slightly slower rate than the side of my body that is further away, my path through time is curved towards the earth, pulling me towards it.",

That expansion is space itself expanding not stuff being thrown outwards. Think like dots on a balloon that being blown up rather than a bomb.   The universe may be flat -  difficult to get my head around what that means but it leads to the conclusions that it's probably infinite. ( so it's the balloon material opened up flat and never ending *but* still being blown up..?.)   We can only see the bit light has had time to travel from and when we do so we are seeing into the past when the light left that  bit - it would have expanded further since then.   At one point in the past the universe was subject to a period of very fast cosmic inflation and then slowe leaving us with a universe that is both more uniform than you ould otherwise expect but also clumpy.   From the fact  that the universe is expanding people extrapolated that originally everything must have come from the same point but there are apparently  reasons to think that 1. the original state Is just unknowable because all the rules we think we know break down by then  and 2. Perhaps couldnt have been a singularity - something to do with temperatures and exponential growth?   As a matter of interest it also seems ( something)  like the space between galaxies is expanding faster than we expect and galaxies themselves are expanding slower than you would expect ( given the effect of gravity) which has led to theories about dark ( unobserved) matter/energy.

Film has some crazy resolution because the particles on it are small so 35mm film is about 4k quality.

As TVs got better it's worth it to go back and scan it with a 4k scanner  The film always had the details and when projected as film they've always been there, but old methods of digitizing didn't capture all the details so we could go back with fancier equipment and get digital copies closer to the film resolution",

The problem with the diamond rain is that it's theoretical. The presence of it depends on how convective the lower atmosphere and oceans are.  If they're highly convective then the diamonds will mix with oxygen and burn to create Co2. Eventually, all the carbon will be burned this way and there'll be no diamond rain.  If they're more evenly layered, or if a thick layer of hot gas is preventing the liquid ocean from coming into contact with the molten surface, then the diamonds will fall into the lava and boil away without getting the chance to bond with any oxygen.

Your reddit.com cookies don't get sent to a request to google.com. However, there are things *in* pages.

    "answer": "In short it would mean the system would have to change for the better.  Yes, you are correct. More automation means less jobs for humans, which in turn means humans don't get paid, and won't be able to afford even to most basic things like housing, clothing, or food.  But that also means there must be a change which makes it possible for people to still be able to survive. Something like a Basic Income, where everyone gets some amount of money regularly that is able to fund those basic things.  Which means people wouldn't be able to not afford housing or food anymore. Which means less homeless.  There's other ways this can go to, but just giving everyone a basic income is, from my understanding, the easiest solution to implement in our system.",

    "answer": "Not an expert but my best guess is mostly cost, and safety.   If a Lipo takes an impact that can puncture it, there's a chemical fire that's spews poisonous gas. If a lead acid gets a puncture, there's a leak that can cause chemical burns if mishandled.  Lead acid batteries last a few years in a vehicle. Given the cost of repairs in other parts of the vehicle, the lifespan of some vehicles, and the low cost of occasionally topping up the battery until it needs complete replacing, having a lead acid vs lipo isn't that big a deal.   Others have already mentioned how lipos struggle at low temps, but high temps are a big issue too. The battery needs to output a kilowatt for a few seconds, to crank the engine, which for a lead acid warms it slightly but no big deal, but for a Lipo, that would bring it to a really high temp. Lipos at high temp are more prone to exploding. So starting an older engine that needs cranking longer than few seconds is rolling the dice.  All this given in mind, lead acids are the best of a bad bunch. The only other work around is using a Lipo as a battery bank, and a super capacitor bank to crank the engine, which solves the high output when cranking. Then adding heating and cooling elements to the battery case to solve the low and high temps during use. Then specially designing a lipo and it's case to make sure during a crash it doesn't explode.  At that point though you've massively increased the cost to install the lipo effectively, making it's use as a battery crank overkill, or go with it and make a hybrid or electric car. Might as well just use a generic lead acid and forget about it.",

    "answer": "Forgive me if any of this is off, I took the applicable courses for this like 20 years ago, so probably don't remember everything. But in essence:   Metabolism is the process by which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. Calories are combined with oxygen to release the energy your body needs to function. You burn calories even while at rest, in order to supply the energy your body needs. The number of calories your body uses to carry out these basic functions is known as your basal metabolic rate. In addition to your basal metabolic rate, two other factors determine how many calories your body burns each day (Food processing (thermogenesis) and Physical activity). A portion of calories not burned through these processes is converted into glycogens (sugar essentially), which are easily accessed and metabolised first. The rest are stored by your body in the form of fat, which is retained to supply energy when there aren't enough other nutrients available.  The weight of calorie dense foods does not translate into the amount of weight gained. That weight is determined by the amount of extra calories stored by your body. To translate this into numbers, each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories. The human body needs to burn about 4100 calories to burn that lbs of fat, which will only happen if there are no other easily accessible calories (like glycogens) available.  So, if you consume something calorie dense that exceeds the number of calories your body needs to function, the rest will be stored as fat. Do this often enough, and you'll gain weight.",

    "answer": "Some people are better at memorising than others. Also, some people are better at reading sheet music than others. Personally, I find it much easier to read sheet music quickly than to memorise pieces.  Some classical musicians absolutely can memorise long and complicated pieces of music. However, it can be useful to have the sheet music in front of you just in case, even if you don't need to read it. For many classical musicians, the sheet music acts more like a quick memory jogger to remember what the next section is, so that you can then pour your effort into playing that as expressively as necessary.  There are definitely some instruments that are more difficult than others, but this can be for a variety of reasons. As a flautist, I can only play one note at a time, so it's arguably a much simpler instrument than piano or any stringed instrument. At the same time, I don't have as much option for relying on muscle memory. On the piano, you can get used to the way your hands move to play a phrase, and the same for guitar - but on the flute, there's not the same \"easy\" muscle memory for being able to play the next phrase without thinking about. (I'm sure a better flautist than I am might disagree with me about this, but I struggled with the muscle memory for playing phrases on the flute much more than I ever did with the keyboard, guitar, or drums.) As a result, the sheet music can be quite helpful as an aid when the muscle memory isn't as well developed for playing a piece.  Finally, it might just be down to convention and habit. Classical musicians almost always have their sheet music handy, so they almost always put it in front of them. Guitarists often practise without sheet music, so they don't feel as much need to put it in front of them.",

    "question": "ELI5: Once a lottery like Mega Millions has a high enough jackpot so that the expected value of the ticket is higher than the cost, why does it still feel like it\u2019s a bad investment to buy a ticket?",
    "answer": "Let's simplify things and consider a lottery that just has one big jackpot and no other prizes. Let's say the odds of winning this jackpot are 1 in 300 million (that's roughly the [odds](https://www.megamillions.com/How-to-Play.aspx) for getting all the numbers right to win the Mega Millions jackpot). Instead of drawing a set of numbers, let's say you just roll a 300 million-sided die and you win the jackpot if it comes up '1'. Let's say the jackpot is $1 billion and it costs $2 for each roll of the die.  Your expected winnings per roll are $1 billion / 300 million = $3.33. Clearly, that's more than it costs and so statistically you expect to make a profit. That is, if you could roll the die enough times, your winnings would equal $3.33 per roll, for a profit of $1.33 per roll. For instance, if you were able to play 1 trillion times, you'd almost certainly make a profit close to $1.33 trillion.  The problem, of course, is that you can't afford to play 1 trillion times. You have neither the time nor the upfront cash to finance that. So it doesn't matter how the statistics work out in the long run. The important thing is: is there a reasonable probability that you'll make a return on your investment before either your time or your money runs out?   Clearly, you need to win the jackpot at least once in order to have a chance to make a profit. Note that you're not guaranteed to make a profit once you win - if it takes too many rolls, you'll still be making a loss. But if you don't win even once, you'll certainly make a loss.  So how often do you need to roll the die to win the jackpot at least once? Well, it's never a sure thing that you'll win, but let's say we want to have at least an 80% probability. How often do we need to roll the die for that? The probability that you'll wint the jackpot at least once in N rolls is 1-p^(N) where p is the probability of not winning, i.e. 1-(1/300 million). So we have to solve 1-p^(N) = 0.8, i.e. p^(N) = 0.2. We can solve this by taking the logarithm of 0.2 in base *p*. If none of that makes sense to you, don't worry, just note that this is a mathematical way of answering the question: how many times do I need to roll this die so that I'll have an 80% probability of winning the jackpot at least once?  The answer turns out to be over 482 million times. That's an investment of $964 million, not to mention how much time it takes to roll a die that many times.  And therein lies the rub. You do not have the time nor the money to play the lottery enough times to have any reasonable hope of making a return on your investment. Not to mention, how are you even going to buy that many lottery tickets? They don't stock that many at your local corner store, and I doubt that Mega Millions is going to allow you to purchase that many tickets from them directly.  Also, note that even with 482 million rolls, there's still a 20% chance that you don't win the jackpot, and then you've accumulated losses of almost $1 trillion. To really be sure of a profit, you need to be playing tens of billions of times.  **In short, the problem is that the expected profit comes from a teenie, tiny probability of winning a large amount of money. If you had a 50% probability of winning $6.66 on a ticket that costs $2, the expected profit would also be $1.33 per ticket, only then you'd only have to play like a dozen times in order to be pretty sure of a profit. So it's not about the expected value of the winnings distribution, it's about how uneven it is.**",
    "follow-up": "thank you that makes a lot of sense now. I do have a question. At what point would it be worth playing even if you could only play once? Is there some ratio of buy-in to probability to jackpot where the odds are so good in your favor that just one play is worth it?",

    "answer": "> It can\u2019t just be inflation  The purchasing power of the dollar going down is literally what inflation is.  The purchasing power of the dollar going up is deflation.  It's bad.  You can see in your link when the purchasing power of the dollar went up in 1930 because that deflation was part of the Great Depression.  Deflation is bad because it kills production.  Suppose prices went down 10%, and people expect that to continue for a few years.  In that case, some people whose car is just old and janky are going to tough it out for another year instead of buying a new car, because with next year's deflation they'll be able to afford a top-of-the-line model instead of a base model.  This is great for them, but it means Ford only sells 800,000 cars instead of 1,000,000.  So, Ford lays off a bunch of people.  Who stop going to restaurants, and stop buying new appliances, and so on.  And the restaurants lay some people off, and so do the department stores selling appliances, and so do the appliance factories.  And all those people stop buying stuff, putting even more businesses out of business and causing even more layoffs.  And Ford also cancels its order for new factory equipment, since it now has more equipment than it needs to make 800,000 cars a year.  This means the equipment manufacturers lay people off, but it also means that Ford's processes don't improve at all.",

Then, you take an antibody against the HA tag which binds it tightly, and you stick a coating of that antibody to tiny sand-sized plastic beads. You put those beads into a column, and run your protein soup through it. Your YFG-HA protein sticks to the antibodies on the beads while everything else runs through.  You put a few rinses of fluid through the plastic sand to really clean up those YFG-HA proteins trapped in there, then you run a different liquid through that breaks the antibody's bond to the HA tag, and you flush out a clean and pure solution of YFG-HA protein.",

    "answer": "There are a lot of really good discussions online already, but what it boils down to is that the string doesn't only vibrate (oscillate) along its full length (the fundamental)\u2014it also vibrates as if it was three strings each having a third the length, and also as if it was five strings each having a fifth the length, and so on and so on.   The frequency of an oscillating string is inversely related to its length (other things being equal, namely density and tension). So a shorter string will oscillate faster and produce a higher frequency than the fundamental.",
    "follow-up": "Hey! Spent the last couple hours diving down a YouTube rabbit hole on the harmonic series and its relation to overtones and music scales. I get that a string with fixed ends can only vibrate at frequencies that produce standing wave patterns with integer multiples of half a wavelength. But how can a string vibrate at several frequencies *at the same time?* If it vibrates at the fundamental then its midpoint is an antinode, but if it vibrates at the second harmonic (or first overtone) then its midpoint is a node. How can both happen at once? Thanks in advance.",

    "follow-up": "> How do we know that it\u2019s super hot when we didn\u2019t even go in it?  Same way we know about lots of properties of the Earth without having been to the exact places they occur \u2014 geophysics.   With regards to the Earth\u2019s interior temperature, this is a combination of extrapolation from direct temp measurements in the bits we can get to (very shallow in terms of the whole planet of course); constraining the state of the interior layers with seismology; constraining the composition of various parts of the Earth with seismology and geochemical analysis of mantle xenoliths and meteorites; using all these constraints to estimate heat production; monitoring of the geoneutrino flux from the Earth (which provides another line of evidence corroborating our estimates of radiogenic heat production); modelling temperatures with thermodynamic principles (adiabatic temperature gradients, the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, the heat conduction equation); performing laboratory experiments on Earth materials at super high pressures and temps then using the results to feed back into the modelling efforts.   Out of all the physical properties of the Earth, it\u2019s true that temperature remains one of the most poorly constrained, but all of the above approaches do allow us to make some good inferences which agree with where the boundaries for the molten and solid regions of the core are according to seismic data; the behaviour of internal earth systems like mantle convection and partial melting in localised places; and key changes in mineral structure (phase transitions) which occur at certain depths. Important examples of such phase transitions are the olivine\u2013spinel transition at 400 km depth and the spinel\u2013perovskite transition at 670 km depth in the upper mantle. The conditions of temperature and pressure (and hence depth) at which these phase transitions take place can be observed in laboratory experiments, so that the temperatures at the transition depths in the Earth can be determined.",

    "answer": "The two of waves coming are discarded batteries and discarded solar panels. Right now, pretty much all lithium ion batteries (from laptop computers and power tools) end up in the landfill. That's chump change compared to the batteries of an electric car.  The thing is, you usually don't throw away a car, you trade it in. If a dealer or manufacturer can recoup costs by recycling batteries, there's a business reason to do it. So that's a plus. I'm willing to bet that car batteries will be largely recycled because the auto industry already has a strong incentive to reclaim what they can.  Solar panels, on the other hand, have about a 30 year lifespan. It's a newer industry, but the construction industry in general, doesn't have the strong incentives for recycling. We're at the cusp of the end of the lifespans of the solar panel wave. It's important that we start talking about recycling and reclaiming minerals from these.",

One of those sub genres focused around the electric guitar and extended solos.  It was called metal because it was all about the metal electric guitar strings.  Heavy metal was when it was almost all focused on loud solos.  This spawned the likes of death metal which borrowed from the goth subculture and merged it with the rawness of heavy metal.",

    "answer": "So I can actually give you the best ELI5 answer, so buckle up. (Pun maybe intended.)  Let's go back and imagine you're at the playground as a kid. You're being pushed around the merry go ground by your dad. Every time he pushes, he forces the merry go round to spin. If he wants to spin you faster, he can push harder and harder. Once he's already pushing as hard as he can, he can still make you spin faster by pushing you with the same strength more often.  The force daddy puts on the merry go round to spin it is torque. The power he generated to spin you around is simply the force he pushed with and how often he did it. If he always pushed with the same force, but one time he pushed twice as often as the other, he'd also be making twice the horsepower for the same torque.  The point of an engine in a car is to spin, just like a merry go round. The pistons firing are like the dads and they push the crankshaft around. What happens is that gas goes into the cylinder and explodes which pushes the piston down and the makes the merry go round. The explosion of the gas pushing the piston down is the torque. The more explosions per second, the more total power being made, even if each explosion has the same amount of force. Car engines in fact get a bit more complicated than that since they don't always make the same torque per explosion, but the formula is the same. Literally, torque is measured in foot-pounds, and horsepower is measured in foot-pounds per second, so it's sort of like the difference between saying 50 miles vs. 50 miles per hour. Two cars travel 50 miles, but the one which did it on less time used more power.",

    "answer": "The US government partly funds itself by issuing bonds (basically a specialized type of loan). Like any loan, they pay interest. For US government bonds issued by the US Treasury, we call this the \"treasury yield\". It's effectively the interest rate you get from loaning money to the US government. These are considered about the safest possible investment so any more risky loan (which is basically all of them) is going to have a higher interest than the treasury yield. If the treasury yield goes up (the government is paying higher interest), that pushes up the interest rate of \\*all\\* loans. It's a signal that investors are concerned that some combination of 1) the stock market might be dropping, so they're putting their money somewhere safer (bonds) and/or 2) investors are worried about inflation and want a higher yield to make up the value they're going to lose to inflation.

Those proteins are the methods that viruses use to enter cells to infect them so making spike proteins is generally done as part of constructing new viruses.  When a cell is infected by a virus and diverted into making new viruses along with their associated spike proteins, the end of that cycle is the death of the cell.

But the actual film you use in your camera *may* be faster (higher ISO) to cope with less light (no studio bright as the sun lights for you). Faster film is more grainy, and 4K may be reaching diminishing returns.  Simplest is just try and scan a few strips and see.

    "answer": "Depends on camera and film.  A cheap lens, small lens or high ISO film (much over ISO 100) will all result in degraded image vs what you\u2019d expect from a modern digital camera, similarly whether the scene is sufficiently in focus may also make scanning to 4K pointless.  When they use film to shoot movies they\u2019re using high quality lenses, a huge lens compared to your point-and-click camera and high quality film because the whole experience is intended to be projected onto a big screen.  The lens quality affects image quality, focus, distortions, etc.  A small lens impacts resolution, but it also affects the speed of film. If you have a huge lens you are gathering a ton of light so can get a better picture from a short exposure of a lower ISO film.  ISO - with film this was a trade off between light sensitivity vs quality. ISO 400 could be more easily used indoors with a regular camera, because it needed shorter exposure, but was grainier than ISO 100 because of how it achieved that sensitivity.",

Its illegal to threaten to kill someone but remember that its that call to arms that's illegal.

However, if you say \"I'm going to kill you\" then include a date, time, how you plan on doing it, etc then it becomes illegal.  Similarly, the argument for freedom of speech cannot be used to defend illegal market manipulation, fraud, insider trading, etc. It is the action that is illegal not the words. Market manipulation is illegal because only a few can benefit from it. In your example Warren Buffet says \"you should buy company X's stock\" so a bunch of people buy it and increase the stock value and then Warren could pull all of his money out and make a ton of money but plummeting the stock price. That would effectively be stealing from the company and the people he told to buy the stock.  Pump and dump like that is very different than typical stock increases because it is not based on an intrinsic value. It is only increasing in value due to a perceived demand based on stock sales but has no relevance to the performance of the company.

The United States has made progress in eliminating some of the institutional, legalized racial discrimination of years past such as slavery, Jim Crow laws, \u201cseparate but equal\u201d schools, and prohibitions on voting or owning land. These hard-fought victories deserve to be remembered and celebrated.  Still, these advances are incomplete. Data on social and economic welfare show disparities between many persons of color and their white counterparts.  * Unemployment rates for Africans Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans are considerably higher than the national average. Growing income inequality increasingly affects minorities.    * In the United States, median wealth for white households is ten times greater than for black households, and eight times greater than for Hispanic households.     * Minority home ownership rates lag behind their white counterparts, and yet research shows that minorities face extra hurdles in getting approved for mortgages.     * African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans are disproportionately affected through every stage of the criminal justice system, despite the evidence that different racial and ethnic groups commit crimes at roughly the same rates.",

    "question": "Eli5: how does credit work?",
    "answer": "You build credit by establishing a history of paying your bills on time.  This can start by simply paying rent or utilities. The longer and more consistently you pay your bills on time the more confident lenders will be in loaning you money.  Paying bills consistently implies that you also have a steady income stream.    Once a sufficient history is established your \"credit\" will make lenders more willing to offer you loans, usually starting with small credit cards (i.e. $300 limit) and/or secured loans (i.e. an auto loan on a car they can repossess if you fail to pay on time). In the beginning you'll still be considered high-risk, so your interest rates and the fees for these will likely be higher, but as you prove your credit worthiness by continuing to make on-time payments on all of your commitments your \"credit\" will improve and they'll offer better terms.    With proof of consistent income along with an expanding history of paying your obligations you can be be approved for more significant secured loans (i.e. a house/condo that can be foreclosed upon if you fail to pay) or unsecured loans (i.e. higher limit credit cards and/or personal loans).    Paying a mortgage on-time is one of the fastest ways to raise your credit worthiness, and with the higher credit rating you'll be able to negotiate lower interest rates and fees, along with higher limits on credit cards.  You may even have lenders pursuing you rather than the other way around.  Failure to pay bills by the due date (or at all) or foreclosure/repossession/bankruptcy can very quickly lower your credit rating.  If you stop paying on an unsecured loan altogether this can also be very detrimental.  As your credit rating drops you can expect that new credit cards and loans will have a higher interest rate, you'll be expected to put down larger down payments and pay higher fees, and possibly be forced to put down deposits (i.e. new apartment, new utility service, new cell phone, etc.).  The cost of your auto insurance can even go up if you have a low credit score.   There are also smaller impacts on your credit score from things such as how frequently you apply for credit (i.e. if you apply for a bunch of credit cards at the same time), how long you've had revolving credit accounts open (the longer the better), etc.",

    "question": "ELi5: How did the Neanderthals go extinct?",
    "answer": "While it's hard to prove one way or the other, there have been sites discovered where interbreeding was found in the remains. Socially, that implies that a hybrid neanderthal-human individual was not only possible, but that such individuals were accepted parts of their community and lived until adulthood (implying they weren't too weak or sickly to survive). Depending on ancestry there's also a very high likelihood that a given individual will carry the markers of minor neanderthal  additions to their genes. It's much lower in sub-Saharan groups, much higher in Eurasian, because neanderthals really didn't backtrack from Eurasia into Africa once they evolved.  There's also a high margin of human-caused extinction through out-competing them. Tools known to be made by neanderthals as opposed to modern human ancestors don't show many significant changes over an astoundingly long time- We were figuring out how to make better tools, they weren't. With better tools, we had better living. Eventually, it's suggested, there just became more and more of us, less and less of them, until we were all that was left.   More like neighborhood gentrification, and less of an explicit war where two groups met on a battlefield and murdered each other to death.     There's also an argument to be made for climate change as a cause. It's a theory that's getting stronger and stronger in regards to Pleistocene megafauna (with the exception of australia); that it wasn't just anthropocentric, and as the ice age ended, biomes changed. Eventually they changed to a point of not being able to support the megafauna.... Or the neanderthals.     There are a lot of factors at play, and we really aren't at a place where we can point to any one of them and say \"That. That's why.\", all we can do is extrapolate from the evidence we have and keep piecing things together as new discoveries are made.     \\--Of Note; I don't have a Ph.D or anything, I just never outgrew the 'dinosaur' phase..",

    "answer": "Much of the problem here is that you\u2019ve loaded the question, haven\u2019t used proper, consistent quantifications, and have flawed logic.   It\u2019s not strictly true that hamsters won\u2019t willingly climb into hamster balls. It\u2019s not clear whether they can ever learn that an open hamster ball with a treat inside will lead to confinement in the ball.  It seems unlikely they recognize the risks. It\u2019s not difficult to find YouTube videos of a hamster going into a hamster ball willingly.   Hamster balls and exercise wheels aren\u2019t the same. A conclusion about a hamster ball doesn\u2019t necessarily also apply to exercise wheels.   You went from \u201cmost exercise wheels\u201d (quantified) to \u201cman-made exercise wheels\u201d (unquantified). Which is it?  Most? All? Many? Some? A few?  Finally, you\u2019ve ignored the obvious data. Hamsters, and other rodents, freely use exercise wheels in preference to running around their enclosures (though they do wander through their enclosures), though IIRC, they\u2019re much less likely to use a wheel if their enclosure is very large. They can\u2019t naturally get the distance from a typical enclosure that they get from their wheels.   The reality is that most people aren\u2019t going to have enclosures with enough space so that hamsters won\u2019t feel the need to use the wheel. So as long as the exercise wheel doesn\u2019t have dangerous problems, why shouldn\u2019t it be encouraged?

    "question": "ELI5 How was Pi discovered?",
    "answer": "I don't know the exact origins or how they got measuments accurate enough to determine it was an irrational number, but you can find it yourself. You can do a simple experiment using paper, ruler, & a writing utensil. Take a cylindrical object like a coffee can or Pringles container. Measure the diameter of the cylinder. It's best to make 3 measurements & take the average of the three since you're eyeballing it. Make a mark on the top edge of the cylinder. Measure the circumference by laying the cylinder down on the piece of paper with the mark touching the paper. Make a mark on the paper that lines up with the mark on the cylinder. Roll the cylinder one rotation & make another mark on the paper lining up with where the mark on the cylinder is. Measure the distance. Divide the distance measured from the paper by the diameter. You should get near 3.14. I have my students repeat this process 3 times to reduce error. I'm reasonably sure there are videos of this on YouTube if my instructions don't make sense. (Sorry for formatting- mobile user)",
    "follow-up": "You can't measure anything accurately enough to determine irrationality. Any measurements in the real world will only be accurate to finitely many decimal places. We also can't construct a perfect circle, and even if we could do all of that, just having a way to determine the entire decimal expansion for pi wouldn't be enough to prove irrationality (in fact, we can calculate as much of pi as we want). Think about it - imagine you know all the digits. how can you show that it doesn't repeats? Even if you check the first 100000000000000000000000, how do you know it doesn't start repeating after the 100000000000000000000001th digit?  Mathematicians don't care about pi as a physical quantity - there's no consideration of physically built circles and measurements. Instead they consider abstractions. And, when treating pi as an abstract concept not a physical thing you measure, you can prove a lot of neat properties about it, one of which is the irrationality!  The irrationality of pi has been proven in a whole bunch of different ways. If you know any calculus, some of the proofs here should be accessible: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof\\_that\\_%CF%80\\_is\\_irrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_%CF%80_is_irrational)  If not, the gist is that you assume that pi is a rational number, then contradict some fact we know about pi - so if pi is rational, it can't be the smallest positive root of the sin function, or if pi is rational, then tan(pi/4) can't be 1 or whatever. It's a form of proof called proof by contradiction, and the gritty details aren't important - just that something we know about pi would be false if pi were rational, so pi must be irrational.",

    "answer": "The GPU is the Graphics Processor (or Processing) Unit. It's a fancy (pricy) way to name what we used to call the Display Adapter, where you plug in your monitor. Presumably it has a processor in it and lots of memory, so arguably it's a whole computer, totally devoted to making the images you see on the screen.  It's very possible that the processor in the GPU is faster and has more memory than the CPU (Central Processor Unit) of the computer itself, as well as having more memory available to it. This is for high end graphics, including high resolution, 3D motion, game graphics. etc..  Back in the day, the Display Adapter simply sent out to the screen whatever was in the display memory area of the computer. It was put there by the CPU. In fact one inexpensive computer (Timex) used the back-scan part of the image generation to run actual computation. So you could speed up your program by selectively turning off the display. That's sort of the exact opposite of having a GPU. lol  Also, some folks use this power of the GPU to do other computation when it's not in use. For example, Bitcoin mining or BOINC computation. In some cases, criminal sites will take over your GPU for their own purposes, without your consent.",

    "answer": "A Discord server is a community. People can chat in different channels. Different channels have different names, and are used for different things. They can also have different rules. However, they are all in one server.   Roles are just, a role I guess. It's quite hard to explain. When clicking on a member on the right, you can see their roles. You can also mention an entire role (mention the members with the role) if the settings of the server allows it.   You can DM people in your server if, again, if the owner allows to do it. They can turn it on or off in the settings. If you DM someone, leave the server, and don't have any mutual servers, you can not DM that person.   You can send a friend request with the \"Add Friend\" button and entering the username and the user's discriminator with the following format:   <username>#<tag>   They must accept the request. Once you friend someone, no matter if they share a mutual server or not, you can DM with him.    Verified Discord servers mean that Discord officially verifies it. It is not very common of course, as you have to apply for verifying your server.   You can create your own server for free, and invite people with the \"Invite people\" button. You can create a one time use, make it valid for a day, and do stuff like that.    You can only join 100 servers though. If you try to join a server, the server invite will display as \"Invite Expired\".   Nitro is the \"premium\" version of Discord. In a server, the owner can upload custom emojis for the members to use. However, you can only use a emoji in that server. With nitro, you can use the emojis from a server anywhere, from your DMs to other servers. Nitro also allows you to use animated emojis.   If you have any other questions, tell me. :)",

    "question": "ELI5: why does the military use \u201cmilitary time?\u201d Isn\u2019t it just a easy to say AM or PM?",
    "answer": "tl;dr Reduces chance for confusion if only part of the time is heard.  There are plenty of good explanations below, but I wanted to add an important note about verbal communication.  We have redundancy built in; how we say things allows a listener to missed a word, but still be able to figure things out, or at least to realize they missed something important.  If someone on a radio says \"7:15 PM\" and the listener does not hear the \"PM\" they have to wonder if the person transmitting meant to leave it off, or if they missed it.  24-hour time builds that into the hours-part of the time by making it \"19 hundred 15\".  When the listener hears \"19\", that clearly indicates that it is in the evening.    If the listener only hears the \"hundred 15\" part, they definitely know they missed the first part of the time.  Even in the shortened version where the transmitter would say \"19 15\", the listener would either hear the entire thing, or know they missed something.  On a side note, it also makes it easier for people to know if \"**midnight**\" is part of the previous day or the next day, where 12-hour time causes some confusion.  For example, is \"12:00 AM, February 14\" immediately after \"11:59:59 PM, February 13\" or immediately after \"11:59:59 PM, February 14\"?  Using 24-hour time, \"00:00:00, February 14\" is more clearly after \"23:59:59, February 13.\"  Some people find both obvious, but I have worked places where midnight is a common time that is part of a notification, and there were always at least a few people who were confused.",
    "follow-up": "This is a good answer. The only thing I'll add is that military time is about removing ambiguity at every level, not just at the am/pm. It does this by requiring that each minute of the day have a singular and unique form of expression, and that incomplete  expressions have essentially no meaning at all.  For example, the times 0100, 0121, 2100 and 2121 can be expressed as, *oh one hundred*, *oh one twenty one*, *twenty one hundred* and *twenty one twenty one*.  If you heard *one*, which of the above times did you hear? The answer is, you didn't hear a complete time. Because no time is expressed as *one*. So you ask the other person to repeat.  Similarly, if you hear *one hundred*, did you hear 0100? Or 2100? Well, since 0100 is never expressed *one hundred* but always as *oh one hundred* you know that what you heard was incomplete. *one hundred* on its own doesn't mean anything.   Not to labour the point,  but if you heard *twenty one*, you also know you missed something because *twenty one* on its own doesn't mean anything.",

    "answer": "There are two answers. Neither of them very clear. One personally, and two society-wise. Both depend on risk. The first to your self , the second as a group.   Your risk is based on how likely you are to actually cross paths with someone infectious and how likely that is to cause you serious harm. So are you in an at risk group and where are you are considerations.   The second - how likely you are to be part of a chain of infection, how at risk are the people around you and how well society - such as the health service is coping.   Masks not perfect and life always holds a risk. In the West we have never masked up for flu which kills thousands of people a year - around 20,000 in the U.K. annually I think - though we vaccinate the at risk. Possibly COVId may have some nasty long term consequences even if you dint get seriously ill. But if the consequences of COVID dropped to equivalent to flu , then it would hardly be unreasonable to behave in a similar way. I say that nit to suggest we wait till then ( if it ever happened) but as a comparative starting point. No one can really say at what precise point in infections and consequences between that \u2018flu\u2019 point and the worst of COVID is the point at which we are \u2018safe\u2019.   I expect government ps will come up with a balance of infection rates, hospitalisations and economics with a dose of politics.   Bear in mind that in the East people regularly wear masks on public transport so as either not to do catch viruses or not to spread them , I guess it\u2019s just considered normal hygiene even for colds.   That\u2019s a long winded way of saying that presuming you are not mandated by the governments and pretty much everyone has had access to a vaccine you will have to decide whether you feel either at risk yourself, or feel that you need to still protect other people.

This energy then heats up the other materials (other protons and electrons and such) nearby. This heating eventually grows out from the center (or core) of the star to the outside, finally leaving the surface and radiating out into space to be the heat and light we know stars emit.

    "question": "ELI5: In finance, it is sometimes said that \u201cthe first million is the hardest.\u201d What makes subsequent millions easier?",
    "answer": "The power of compound interest!  The more money you have, the easier it is to make money.  Let's take a simple example.  If you put $10,000 in the bank at a 10% interest rate, it will take you 24 years for that $10,000 to turn into $1M.  Not too shabby.  Now, if you leave that $1M in the bank, it only takes **7** years for that $1M to turn into $2M!  Having that $1M to start with means you make your second million in only 1/4 of the time.  Leave that $2M in the bank, and you earn your next million in just **4 years**.  The next takes just 3 years, the one after that another 3, the one after that just two.    In fact, after just another 24 years (the time it took you to earn your first million) you'll have $10M in the bank and you are making a million _every single year_.",

    "question": "ELI5: When they say that human body is made of 73% water, does they mean actual \"H2O\" aka water, or just liquid in general?",
    "answer": "They mean actual water. The proteins and the minerals would turn into lumps without the water to act as both a solvent and a carrier medium.  Now of course none of this water is \"pure\", as it's full of all manner of the chemicals of life.  The other thing is that there are important chemical transactions that either consume or produce water because both oxygen and hydrogen are key components of virtually every molecule in your body.  For example when plants make sugars in photosynthesis they consume water and bind it together in chains with carbon to produce glucose. (It's not actually chains of water but it's groups of hydrogens and oxygens that came from the water molecules and the CO2 consumed by the reaction.)  When your body uses sugar The same amount of water and carbon dioxide is recreated as the sugar is broken down.   Without the water to float around in many molecules would literally snap or be crushed by their own charges and weights.  Water is possessed of many strange and useful properties that assist, or mechanically support, ongoing chemical reactions and various structures. It's also a great way to transport molecules from one place to another.",

Let's say you have a cup of tap water, one of dirty puddle water, one of distilled water, and one of stinky bog water - they're all the same water. If you could remove the stuff that's dissolved or suspended in all of them, they'd have the same smell, taste, color, etc. There's only one kind of H2O, and all other characteristics to what we refer to as different kinds of water are things added to the H2O, which are not H2O.",

    "question": "ELI5 What is the difference between radioactivity and radio waves? Why are they named so similarly?",
    "answer": "Radio active elements are those that are unstable and will spontaneously decompose. This process will see them emit one of three types of radiation depending on the element in question. You can see alpha, beta, or gamma decay. Alpha and beta are emissions of protons and helium nucleus. Gamma is an emission of very high energy light.   Radio waves are a form of very low energy light. Even though it is light like gamma it doesn\u2019t carry enough energy to knock electrons out of place (this is called Ionization) thus making it pretty much harmless. The spectrum of light goes from radio to microwave to infa red to visible to ultra violet to gamma. Only when you get to UV will the light have enough energy to do real damage.   As to why they are named that way I have no idea. Also this is more physics than chemistry in terms of the flair.",
    "follow-up": "Oh, thank you so much for differentiating the kinds of emission, very informative.  >This process will see them emit one of three types of radiation depending on the element  Does that mean that no radioactive element does more than one emission, say a particle and a photon at the same time?     \\*\\*And yes, you're completely right, I realized too late that we're more in the physics realm",

Two of them are a type of subatomic particle being expelled from an atom, but the third type is called gamma radiation.

    "question": "Eli5 - if women have so little testosterone, how do female bodybuilders and athletes get so much muscle?",

Anabolic steroid use in women increases testosterone, and causes irreversible thickening of the vocal chords. This is why many female bodybuilders have slightly (if not very) masculine voices, or an \u201cedge\u201d that was not present previously. It also causes changes to facial structure and the jawline.",

It is interesting though how a woman who has trained for several years lifting can acquire more muscle and be bigger than an 18 year old guy who has never trained but has more than 10x her testosterone and is in the peak of hormones. Is T that important for growth therefore? Since if the same guy started lifting he could get stronger, does the hormone just require stimulus in the form of physical activity. Most teen boys put on muscle during puberty without weightlifting....",

I genuinely wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find out that many people who thought they were poisoned, were actually severely allergic to a food. Recognizing food allergies is becoming much more main stream even only in the last several decades as we learn more about it. It\u2019s very hard to say that the data suggests we are becoming more allergic to things as time progresses, rather than we are acknowledging and realizing people are becoming allergic to things.   For instance, I was allergic to dairy as a kid, i was sick frequently and had terrible breath even after brushing and using mouth wash. It wasn\u2019t until I couldn\u2019t afford milk anymore in college that I realized I was allergic to milk. It took my parents years to admit that I was allergic and not just a sick kid.",

It expensive too install the fibre cables needed for high speed internet and if there\u2019s only a handful of homes in a rural area then there\u2019s little incentive for the provider to do so.   Broadband speed is also reliant on the distance it has to travel so in a rural area where houses are likely to be spread far apart and located a fair way away from the cabinets and telephone exchanges it is delivered from, it will typically be considerably slower than in urban areas.",

Expel your breath and you will die from lack of oxygen if it goes on too long.  Assume you don't need to breath, your body's fluids will start boiling near the surface of your skin and anywhere else exposed, followed by swelling, loss of body control, and death.  Assume that doesn't happen, your body would still be radiating heat and you would freeze to death.
